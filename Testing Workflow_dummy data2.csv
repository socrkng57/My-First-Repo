Dear Team,

Site 724111 is having problems when trying to perform questionnaires using the
Chromebook.

They mentioned that it seems like an issue with the device itself, it does not
respond to touch in the touchscreen, nor using a mouse/keyboard. Is it possible
to send this one back to you and send them a new one?

Please let us know so we can tell the site.

Thank you.

not showing visit 100% complete

 

Message:

 



Hi ERT Support team,

 

Below is screenshot of the Cogstate assessment complete status. 

 

Screening and Week 0 visits show 50% complete but the battery tests were
completed and data received.  Therefore we are not sure why completion is at
50%.

 

Can you investigate and advise a solution please.  Thank you.

Thanks for reaching out, I attach the most recent newsletter for the AACM study which contains a section on troubleshooting for the Cogstate Battery. If none of these suggestions work (tablet orientation to be horizontal and fixed, browser maximized, good Wifi connection etc) could you please let me know what the error shows so I can provide some further troubleshooting? You could also try asking the ppt to complete the practice test on the participant’s tablet to see if you encounter the same issue.

Please let me know if you need to cancel the CDR sessions scheduled for today.

Could you please confirm if a phone number was created when this participant was set up in RCC? If so it is possible that the invite was sent to the phone number provided in the RCC profile instead. I can confirm on our end that an invitation was sent, and I just tried to re-send it again.

Could you please ask the ppt to use the study tablet and select ‘Forgot My Password’ and try to enter either the email and/or phone numbers associated within the account in RCC to see if she is able to gain access to her RCC account.

One of my participants did not receive the redcap cloud invitation email to activate their account for clinical assessments. Is there a way to try to send them another email or should I have them keep checking?

Thanks for reaching out. I can confirm that Ana Llambias is available to complete this session at 2pm today. As the session is being booked with less than 12 hours until the scheduled time of the meeting I will need to create the appointment manually on your behalf. As such, could you please provide me with the following information:
 
 
 
You will need to create a new updated zoom link for the session and password as the old link probably won’t work anymore. Let me know if you have any issues!

Also, if there is nothing in junk, could you please let me know what message the tablet displays when a password reset is made on the tablet?

Hi Doug,

I hope this email finds you well. I’m just reaching out as our rater Liam let us know your ppt had some issues resetting their password in RCC. I’m attaching the most recent copy of our newsletter which provides guidance on resetting passwords in RCC which you may find useful (particularly if using an iPhone to try and reset). Please let me know if you require any further assistance on this or whether you have managed to reset and wish to reschedule this session for later today. Liam has let us know he has availability later to accommodate an appointment if needed.

I wanted to see if I was able to update the study partner ID. I did not input it correctly ,
I wrote 48385 instead of 48385.01.
I just wanted to see if there was a way of correcting it.

If the ppt is able to log in on her tablet once the password is reset, then it’s likely the tablet is populating the first character as a capital letter or similar automatically. Also just a note that if the ppt is changing their PW on a iPhone, the new password might not be taking effect as on iPhones the error message stating “this password doesn’t meet the minimum requirements” populates but the ppt needs to scroll up to see it.

Hi Tracy,
 
Sorry to hear the ppt is still having password issues. I just spoke with my colleague and they have seen this before where the ppt is inputting the wrong password and not catching it. Could you please verify if the ppt is able to log into RCC on another device, e.g. a smartphone or their PC, once they reset their password using the Forgot My Password function on the tablet?

Hi Tracy,
 
Thank you for reaching out. Regarding the orientation issue, if it is locked this is something which Clinical Ink can remediate, as they will need to remote in and take the orientation lock off. @support@clinicalink.com please could you remote into tablet Tablet IMEI#358590101130746 for the AACM study as the participant is unable to launch the battery correctly due to it being locked in portrait mode?
 
Regarding the password reset for this ppt, please ask the ppt to select the ‘Forgot my Password’ in the bottom right of the log in screen on the study device. They should be able to reset their password and log in through here.
 
 
 
Please let me know if you require any further assistance.

Hello Cogstate,
 
The above noted participant is unable to reset the password, the tablet has locked her out after several failed attempts.  We are at a standstill at resolving the problem.  Can a remote/manual reset of the tablet be done?  Tablet IMEI#358590101130746
 
During our initial log in for the practice test, the tablet was displaying the information vertically when she had her tablet turned horizontal. We tried every angle to resolve the problem.  The practice test could not be initated because she was unable to see all of the information completely.   I sent an email, as well as called and left a message regarding the issued, but no feedback.  Please advise, as this is hindering the progress of the patient's visit schedule.

Hello Tracy,

Due to the face that we cannot resolve the orientation lock for this subject's device. We advise contacting the Lilly team for a replacement device, as the Cogstate battery will need to be launched from landscape mode.

Thank you,
Morgan Beadle
Clinical Ink Product Support

Ppt 41183 (CSC Tracy Reed) – Cogstate Battery launching but not displaying correctly. Cogstate have reached out to ask for device number for this ppt as we believe the orientation is locked on ppt’s device and it is launching in portrait mode even when held horizontally. Clinical Ink will need to be contacted to fix this issue – to remote in and remove the fixed orientation so battery can launch correctly. Pending CSC response."

Hi Jesse,
 
Thanks for reaching out. I just replied to your voicemail but thought I would follow up here too- can you please check the subject’s account in RCC to see if there are any other details associated with the account, e.g. a phone number in the account. If this is the case then the phone # will override the email for log in, so please ask the ppt to try and log in using this as the username and see if you are able to obtain access.

Hi Katie,
I don't know, I have never encountered this before, so I'm not sure what would work.  I was thinking we could just delete her and then re-enter her info including her email and same subject ID but, I will do anything that you think will work.  I'm just afraid having a different subject ID in RCC then in the other platforms is going to be to confusing and may cause more problems down the road.

Hi Karin,
 
When you navigate to the Cogstate ID to the left of the subject number, if you copy what is in there and paste it into the myRCC username field, does it still come up as username not found? REDCap Cloud Copying and pasting what was invited will help us rule out if the username is being entered incorrectly.

Hi Karin,
 
If RCC is saying that the username is not found when sending the password reset then it’s possible that the username entered in the ppt’s RCC account is incorrect. Could you please double check that the email linked to the ppt’s account is correct by clicking on the Cogstate ID to the left of the subject number in RCC? And then verify with the ppt that the email they are using to log in is the same as the one they were invited with?

Hi Karin,
 
Okay, thanks for confirming that. With the invalid username, can you ask the ppt to actually copy and paste their email username from RCC into the ‘Forgot my Password’ section of the log in on the study tablet? I just want to triple check it is being entered correctly, and not auto-capitalising the username or anything, which could cause the ‘invalid username’ error message.

Hi Karin,
 
Thank you, I can confirm the invitation was sent to this participant as I can see the green tick to the right of the subject number in RCC. Did this ppt try to set themselves up an account in RCC prior to clicking on the invitation link (due to the fact that she could not locate the RCC invite in her emails)? If so this may cause the invalid username issue. Could you also confirm that a phone number was not used when setting up this ppt in RCC?

one of the site's Rater tried to access to her Cogstate account on the laptop

Hello-

In October 2022 I received my ""Welcome to the Cogstate esource Platform"" email.
Because we were not ready to start, I don't believe I activated my account.
Since it is so old, the link is no longer active. I am scheduled to complete my

prior to that time, I would greatly appreciate it. Email is my best form of

To connect to Data, just toggle off the WiFi option. You may need to select “Forget” the WiFi network as well. Then Data Roaming should be initiated:

Hi Moultrie,
 
Just a thought – have you asked the ppt to try to launch the battery whilst positioned closer to their Wifi router in the house? Also try to disconnect and reconnect to the participant’s Wifi (in settings) to see if this makes a difference to the connectivity. I would advise that during the Cognitive Testing that the participant stands as close to the Wifi router as possible. If this still doesn’t work then we have had participant’s in the past complete assessments where there is a stronger Wifi connection (e.g. in a friend’s home). @Moultrie Vanderhorst -I  see that you were unsuccessful in removing Wifi on the participant’s device, could you please provide any assistance in helping Moultrie do this Malia?

Yes. I don't think this is a data issue. She is able to log into Cogstate and Zoom with no issue. It's the loading of the test when she was on with the Radar trying to complete the Cognitive Test part 1.

Thank you for your email.

Thank you also for attaching the set up guide, I can confirm the equipment was set up correctly.

The test supervisor stepped out during the last assessment. I wanted to flag this in case there are some data inconsistencies.

Moving forward we will ensure the supervisor is present in the room at all times during the test.

Hi Tracy,

I’m just following up again for an open ticket I have for ppt 37516. Is the participant now able to open the battery? We seem to be having several ppts with this issue and I’d just like to double check the Wifi for this ppt’s device if this is still an issue. Please check in with the participant and ensure that when they launch the battery they are close to their Wifi router. If the battery still wont launch, please try to disconnect the Wifi and ‘Forget’ the Wifi network in the settings and the tablet should connect to data. Please let me know if this solves the issue (you can try to launch the battery on the ppt’s device to see if this rectifies the problem).

I am contacting you because CSC Diana Giraldo [GiraldoD GiraldoD@centralclinicalservices.com] does not have access to the live Clinical Ink application in the tablet. She is only in the training environment. She contacted helpdesk and they  have her contact the study team.

As far as I know, she completed training successfully and I hope you can help her get this right.  I am working on a site transition and I need her to have all her accesses.

Below are a couple of screen shots that Diana provided for the tablet

Hi Diana,

No problem! You should be able to see the below sites now in RCC, I removed your training site access as all the training was completed, and the below sites are now live. You may need to sync your tablet to see the updates.

Hi Diana,
 
I did see you’d previously completed your courses on Instructor, so once the practice test is complete I can mark your training off manually. Apologies for the inconvenience on this.
 
To launch the practice test, please navigate back to RCC on your PC and click on the mock ppt number, and in the top right, select ‘add event’ and choose ‘practice’ from the drop down, and ‘save and exit’.
 
 
 
When you go back to the tablet you should see the option to launch the practice test.

Hi Diana,
 
I can see the previous curriculum completed, you will need to complete the final applied training step as shown below. Kerry re-enrolled you in the courses, but once you put “enroll” next to each course, it will automatically recognize you have previously watched the module. 
 
 
 
To complete the applied training on your study tablet, I have attached the instructions included in your welcome email.
 
Please let us know if you have any questions.
 
Best,
Delaney

I think you are referring to the Cogstate Instructor Training ?  I have just re enrolled you so you can perform the training test. It’s the last part before you can become active in Red Cap Cloud.  Please let me know if this solves the problem.

Hi Daisy, 
 
Would it be possible that we shift these appointments to Tuesday April 4th? Please let me know if this works for the study partner and participant. Failing that, would the study partner be available at 5.30pm on the 11th so that I can shift this appt to be with Milse? Please let me know if either of these works.

Thanks for reaching out. Unfortunately, both subjects are not available to conduct the visit at the same time, this is why we split the visit. Also, I don't have the option on my end to choose which rater can conduct the visit. 
 
Are you able to assist me with that? I don't want to cancel the appointments as the subject is traveling and also has a busy schedule for the month. 
 
Please advise -

Hi Daisy,
 
I hope this email finds you well. I’m reaching out as I noticed you have split appointments on ppt 33085 with different raters (Ana and Milse) on April 11th.
 
First, it is preferred that a CDR combined session is booked, and that the split CDR sessions are made only when this is impossible. 
 
Second, if the split CDR sessions are required, then both the study partner and study participant portions must be conducted with the same rater.
 
Please either cancel both split CDR bookings and book a combined CDR session or amend one of the split CDR sessions so that they are conducted with the same rater. 
 
If you need any help with this, please don’t hesitate to get in touch!
 
Many thanks,

The email invite cannot be moved between subjects as the subject account (Cogstate ID) is linked to whatever email is used when invited.

To correct this issue, Cogstate will have to reverse the previous request and update the subject number listed as 28870 to 28869 to have the correct email address used. I have looped in our data manager for best next steps for this piece.

Even with this, the participant should be able to login with the email address invited under 28870, can you try the troubleshooting with the below?

To troubleshoot the username:
1.	Copy the participants email from the invited email into this link: https://myrcc.login.redcapcloud.com/ 
2.	Select “Forgot Password?” in lower right to send a password reset/account reset.
3.	Repeat with phone number if phone was entered.

Hi Delaney,
 
Yes, I do have another question or concern for clarification.
 
When I initially created this Subject, the wrong e-mail address was utilized under ""28869."" I had to create another Subject (28870) to have been able to register with the ""correct"" e-mail address. Cogstate was able to help me switch the information to the correct Subject..
 
The issue is that your e-mail states to use the same email address that was ""originally"" used and the original email address in this case was incorrect.
 
Does this make sense? I can forward you the previous e-mail threads with what was done before.
 
 
 
Thanks, and I do apologize for the confusion.
 
Jazmin

Hi Jazmin,
 
It appears the participant did not login to their invited email or phone. Can you confirm no phone number was added to the participants account?
 
The participant will need to use the exact email address (such as caps or no caps, special characters etc.) as was invited OR the phone number if it was added during set-up to have the account linked.
 
To troubleshoot the username:
1.	Copy the participants email from the invited email into this link: https://myrcc.login.redcapcloud.com/

Today we had to cancel subject 28869 Cogstate Testing Part 1 due to an error on the Subject's tablet. Here is a screenshot of the error message:"

It sounds like the participant is trying to launch the assessment with the device held vertically. The error message populated will read along the lines of “the battery failed to launch. Please check your wifi connectivity or contact your administrator”. 

Confirm with the participant before launching that the device is on its side, with the power button on one side or the other. 

Please reach out if you have trouble launching with these provided steps.

Hi Poly,
My understanding is that Jiake booked her central rater at 1pm but asked for an earlier time, which I think might be the booking you are referring to here. Jiake’s patient just pre-screen failed after a discussion with the investigator this morning, so will not be coming in. Since I missed booking mine, I will take Jiake’s booking.

So just to confirm we have one central rater booking for our site, Sydney Emeritus Research at 10:30am today?

Thank you.

Kind regards.

My apologies, I just realised we have a patient booked for screening today, sorry this slipped passed my eyes as we recently had a change in booking methods with recruitment and the display of ACW0008 bookings changed.

Would there be any chance we can have a central rater any time rom 10:30am-12pm (Sydney, Australia time) or even later today (13th Feb)?

Hello,

I am writing regarding an online booking I have made for a central rating screen as part of clinical trial ACW0008. On Monday 13 February we have a participant attending for first screening visit at our clinic at 11:00hrs. The two times available to book for the central rating screen was 0900hrs and 15:00hrs. I understand that these times coincide with the availability of the central rater, however I wanted to get in touch and see if there is any way it could be conducted closer to midday or early afternoon after consent has been signed. I have currently booked the 0900hr time slot but will change it depending on your advice.

Thank you for your help.

Subject: FW: reschedule - MINI_ HAM-D

Hi Cogstate Team,
I realised my email did not send yesterday (due to a dot after the com in the email address) notifying that the patient rescheduled to 9am and if we can possibly have a rater at 10:30 or 11am whatever suits. It was originally booked for 12pm and requested for 11:30am in the notes. 

Booking details 




Service Name

	Central Rating (MINI & HAM-D) - Screening




When

	Tuesday, January 31, 2023
12:00 PM - 1:30 PM
(UTC+10:00) Canberra, Melbourne, Sydney

Subject: reschedule - MINI_ HAM-D

Hi,
I have a booking for a rater for tomorrow the 31st Jan 12-1:30pm but asked for 11:30am in the notes. The patient just called reschedule to 9am, will it be possible to have a rater at 10:30am/11am, if not possible we will keep 11:30am and change the order of events in the visit.
I tried to reschedule via the confirmation email but just brings me to a screen to do a new booking.

Sorry for the inconvenience and please let me know. 
Thank you!

That is correct, you will need to select “practice” for the practice test to generate. The central rater will switch the participant to “in-study” at the beginning of Cog. Testing part I.

HI Tamara,
 
Thanks for reaching out. I can see in RCC that subject 42017 is set up as ‘In-study’ for the AACM study. Please navigate to the Cogstate ID to the left of the subject number, and select edit in the top right, and select ‘practice’ from the drop down, then save and exit.
 
 
 
Then select the subject number, and select ‘add event’ in the top right of the screen. You’ll then see ‘Practice’ on the drop down list, please save and then the practice test will appear on the events page for the subject. The ppt can now launch the practice test on their tablet.
 
Please let me know if you need any further help!

Subject: RE: 15T-MC-AACM - RCC/Cogstate registration issue - assistance needed
 
Hello, 
 
I am having issues registering a subject for a cognitive practice run that was to start today at 11am EST.  I have since called to postpone until I am able to get it fixed. 
 
On Friday, I went in and scheduled the CDR rater appointments (Combined for 3/24 and Cog pt 1 for 3/27) and the practice test for today.   But when I went in this morning to assign the practice test there was no option to do so.  Can you please assist me with this?
 
The site is 15700 and the subject is 42017.
 
Thank you!

The Rater Administered form completion status shows 50% but this is not reflected of a form being done. This status only reflects the CRF completion status, and currently there is a CRF pending. This could be because of an open query or additional investigation from the data team.

Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Hello,
 
Subject 16020 was scheduled for CDR combined yesterday at 6pm. When we got on the call, the forms would not populate for the rater so we had to move it to today. Partner in the morning and participant in the evening. So that made the Cognitive test part 1 that was scheduled for today to be moved. The subject can only do evenings for this and I do not see a time. She has to complete all 3 assessments within 7 days. Can you help?

Thanks for reaching out. If you navigate to the Cogstate Battery Assessment Confirmation I can see the practice test was completed yesterday 13th March. I think it only shows the 6th on the event date because that was the date the forms were first opened.

 
It now just needs to be saved and marked as complete in the top right corner.

Hi Delaney,

Unfortunately, using the subject's phone number also did not work to log her in to RCC.  What else can we try? We have her Part 1 rescheduled for today in about an hour. She gets home in about a half hour and we can try again to reset her password again using her email. Maybe if I try resending the invite? Any suggestions are welcome.

Hi Delaney,
 
This subject's phone number was originally entered when she was first registered in error.  It was quite a headache back at her V2 getting that resolved and setup with her email.  This subject's V2 was back in August 2022. Why would it reset with her phone number again? In the subject's profile on RCC it shows her email and phone number. I am unable to edit that.

Hi,

The participant was not able to make this appointment due to the time and us not knowing which part she would have to complete. I booked for 12 pm CST tomorrow but she would like to know if something becomes available today. 

Thanks

Hi LaShonda,
 
Apologies, I think I was confused as I didn’t realise this was the ppt who had skipped the V2 visit. I’m not sure if we were made aware that the practice assessment in RCC was also skipped for this participant, has this been communicated by yourself to Lilly? I think we can proceed with the V9 Psychometric session as we can see that the V9 CDR was completed on the 8th and there have been some delays already to this psychometric due to the ppt having COVID.
 
Kind regards,

Good morning,
 
Sorry, I was a bit confused. I took on this site a few months ago and learned that because of a miscommunication with the previous CSC that the V2's were not completed. It was decided by the study team during that time to just complete the CSSRS and forgo the rest of the V2 assessments. The participant is now on V9, should i still complete the V2 practice?
 
Thanks

Hi LaShonda,
 
I’m just reaching out as rater Rochelle let me know that she is scheduled a V9 with ppt 16693 this morning but that she could not see that either the practice test or the V2 has been completed for this ppt. Could you please confirm subject/visit number for the appt at 9am EST? If this is the correct ppt, we will need to cancel the appointment so that the practice test can be completed prior to the V2 CDR. Please let me know if you have any questions.

Hi Valerie,
 
Thanks for reaching out. I just checked these ppts in RCC and can see V2s are complete for both subjects. The 50% progress as shown below relates to an outstanding query and does not mean the tests are incomplete. Apologies I know this is confusing!
 
 
 
 
 
For this subject, I can see all parts of the test are complete as the icon to the left of each part shows the form has been opened (if a part hasn’t been opened it will show a filled in circle).

Currently, the functionality to update email addresses is not configured into the system. The email address the participant used to sign up for the study is the email address linked to their account and at this time cannot be updated. 
 
If the participant cannot access their previous email address, please alert us immediately.

I see that the practice test was launched but no data was collected. The audit log does not reflect any errors.

Please have the participant start the battery over again, a couple of items that could have caused the “crash” – 

•	The participant WiFi disconnecting before the tests are started
•	Hitting the home button on the tablet

Subject: participant practice testing

Hello, 

For AACM I5T site under PI Horstman:  I was working with participant 36881 from site 15550 (Care Access Sun City).  The patient started the practice cognitive testing session, but was telling me they were doing a card test, and not the standard practice.  The system was not registering any testing as completed on my visible end, and then the session crashed on the patient.   The patient is scheduled for Visit 2 on 08Mar2023 at 6am Arizona time, so they need to complete this practice before then. 

Is there any error showing that we can correct on our end?

Thank you,

I’m replying to your other email on this thread as the other contained PII. Cogstate is blinded to any participant details (including the email address). I will remove this email from our records.

It appears the participant might have changed their login information when the account was created. We have seen this issue before the email was updated after the invitation was sent (which generated the username). After the username was generated, the email was changed, but it’s not recognized as the username when trying to login. 

I will include on the request for the username.

I have completed the instructions below on relaunching the practice test for subject 32229. The subject was able to log in and when he “begins assessment” the error: There was an error launching the Cogstate Battery. Please make sure you are using the study device, stable internet.

Are we able to provide the subject with details on how to correct this? 

Kind Regards, 
Brittany Knight"

Good Morning Alexandra, 

The protocol that I am referring to is IRB 16-005982 “ROR1662: Observational study evaluating neurocognitive function in patients with primary CNS malignancy receiving radiation treatment to the brain.”

When I try to install the COGSTATE database to my computer, it shows this pop-up. I have attached it to this email. 

Thanks,

Hello Jennifer,

Thank you for submitting a support ticket through the Cogstate website. My name is Alexandra Vahle, and I am a site services associate here with Cogstate.

Could you please clarify which study protocol and site number you are working under? Typically Cogstate will send sites in their partnered clinical trials a device with the Cogstate hardware already installed to use to administer the Cogstate battery.

Hi Katie,
 
I try to schedule combined CDR session mostly. The subject 37867 and study partner both live in different states. The study partner is working, and the subject is very busy with doctor appointments and other stuff. I checked the central rating calendar, and the appointment times are very limited, and both are not available at the same time. My apologies as I didn't know that both need to be scheduled with the same rater. I will try to reschedule their appointments with the same rater. Thank you for letting me know.

	EXTERNAL EMAIL: Use caution before replying, clicking links, and opening attachments. 

Hi Sri,
 
I hope this email finds you well. I’m just reaching out as I noticed the split CDR sessions for ppt 37867 are booked with different raters. 
 
First, it is preferred that a CDR combined session is booked, and that the split CDR sessions are made only when this is impossible. 
 
Second, if the split CDR sessions are required, then both the study partner and study participant portions must be conducted with the same rater. The easiest way to achieve this is through the aforementioned combined CDR session.
 
Please see excerpt from the Manual of Operations for further guidance:
 
•	Cogstate Battery practice session must occur at least 1 day and no more than 7 days prior to the Study Partner CDR interview.
•	The CDR Rating session must occur prior to the psychometric Part I rating session.
 
•	CDR Rating Combined Session 90mins
o	To preserve data collection, It is ALWAYS preferred   to use a combined CDR session (study partner and participant). 
 
•	If a combined CDR session is not feasible (emergency cases):
•	The Study Partner portion MUST occur before the Study Participant portion and both sessions MUST occur within 4 calendar days of each other. Please book both sessions at the onset to ensure these strict time lines are adhered to.
•	First, CDR Study Partner Session 45mins
•	Second, CDR Study Participant Session 45mins
•	Psychometric Rating Combined Session 90mins
o	This visit cannot be split and must be conducted in one session. This rating is to conduct the Part I for the study participant 
•	The study partner and participant should be informed of the ratings total booked time (i.e. the participant and partner should plan on the rating lasting 90mins 
 
 
Please either cancel both split CDR bookings and book a combined CDR session or amend one of the split CDR sessions so that they are conducted with the same rater. 
 
If you need any help with this, please don’t hesitate to get in touch!

I hope this email finds you well. I’m just reaching out regarding your appointment today at 8.30am EST with rater Ana for ppt 39596. Ana alerted us that the V2 Rater and self administered forms have already been completed in RCC, but the practice test has not been generated or completed, so I believe this ppt has been set up as ‘In-study’ rather than ‘Practice’ in RCC. 

 

Unfortunately the completion of the V2 forms ahead of the V2 visit is a protocol deviation and as such as we will need to notify the sponsor. I am also going to loop in members of the data management team @Hannah Obasoro and @Kat Markowski to assist in advising on next steps (i.e. whether we can simply move this data from the V2 forms to be the ‘practice’, or whether any further action needs to be taken from the ppt, i.e. if they need to re-take the practice test). They will email you to confirm a data move if needed and once accepted by yourself we can work on rescheduling this ppt.

I am going to go ahead and cancel this appointment as these items will need to be resolved before the session can go ahead; please inform the participant and my apologies for the short notice on this. 

To generate the practice test form in RCC please follow the following steps:

Select the ‘Cogstate ID’ to the left of the subject number:
 
Once in the set up screen, please select edit in the top right corner, and from the drop down list, change ‘In-study’ to ‘Practice’, then press save and exit.

Finally, select the Subject number, and press ‘Add event’ in the top right. From the drop down, select ‘Practice’, then save and exit. The practice test will appear on the event page.

Please let me know if you require any assistance on this or have any questions.

Message:

Hi there,

The AbbVie team raised a couple of sites to Cogstate that reported a technical
issue during the administration. Please see below list and subject IDs.
Could you kindly reach out to the sites to see if they need support? The details
are unknown, but we are trying to be proactive here. Please let us know if you
need any further information from our end.

* 101 (subject 101001)
* 103 (subjects 103001, 103004)
* 107 (subject 107001)
* 108 (subject 108001)
* 128 (subject 128002)
* 140 (subject 140001)

Please note, some of these technical issues reported are one off as some of the
sites have been able to administer the assessment.

Warm regards,
Aki

Hi Cinthya,

Thank you for the explanation. I have removed the duplicates to what you have provided below. 

I noticed when I went to cancel these, the cancellation confirmations did not go through to you as the email address was “undeliverable” (c.perez@careaccess). This may have caused the duplicates as this isn’t a valid email address and therefore you wouldn’t have received the confirmations.

Kind regards,

Hi Delaney,

Good morning,

I remember I have cancelled the extra meetings for pt 44517 using the “Manage Booking” link. The appointments that I currently have for this pt are:

10Feb2023 at 10:30 CST
13Feb2023 at 10:00 CST

I don’t have other appointments in my calendar for this pt now, but in case there are other appointments in need of cancellation for this pt, I apologize for any confusion. Please let me know how I can cancel them.
The Cognitive testings Part-I that were booked and cancelled at the time of the visit due to delays in login belong to pt 40146. This pt is being evaluated by the PI because she has problems using the tablet. The re-scheduling was due to the time the pt takes to access the systems, and the raters were not in the ability to wait until pt completes login (sometimes 20-30 minutes after the scheduled visit time). She also has a very difficult temperament, and despite being requested to join the call at least 30’min in advance, she insists on coming 15 or sometimes 10 minutes before the appointment. I have sent an email to LaShan about this, and the medical team has suggested to request the PI consideration to decide if the pt will continue in the study.

I will be glad to provide more information about these or other pts if requested.

Best Regards,

Cinthya

Hi Cinthya,

I hope this email finds you well. I am reaching out as it appears we missed you for an appointment for participant 14550-44517. Upon further investigation, this participant has four visits scheduled for V2 assessments.


07Feb23 – Cognitive Testing Part I 2:30pm EST
10Feb23 – CDR Partner and Participant Interview 11:00am EST
10Feb23 – CDR Partner and Participant Interview 11:30am EST
13Feb23 – Cognitive Testing Part I 11am EST

Can you please confirm the appropriate dates and times for these appointments, then cancel the sessions that are duplicates? Having multiple appointments for the same participant takes up slots where other participants could be seen. Thank you in advance.

Kind regards,
Delaney

Patient will not redo the practice test. She says she knows she was near the end, and she will not do the test again. Further, we are on a tight timeline with her scheduled to leave town this Saturday Feb. 11th, the day after her final memory test. The CDR needs to occur today as scheduled. 

I need the CDR that was canceled, reinstated. I cannot do this on my end because I am within the 24 hour window.

Thanks for the heads up. 

Just fyi, it is much easier for the CSC to reschedule the rating assessments than to cancel them and start over. This saves us a considerable amount of time to not have to re-enter all the visit info, the CSC info, and Zoom info into Bookings. This can all be transferred instead if you reschedule, instead of cancel. In the future, you might consider holding off on canceling bookings until you talk to the CSC. ??

Thanks for getting the needed info.

	EXTERNAL EMAIL: Use caution before replying, clicking links, and opening attachments. 

Hi Darcie,

My apologies, I have just heard back from DM and the recommendation is that the practice test needs to be completed in full so that the participant may be exposed to each of the tests prior to their baseline visit. As a result, could you please navigate to the subject in RCC and in the top right corner select ‘Unmark as Complete’? This will allow the ppt to be able to relaunch the practice test on their tablet.

However, the protocol also states that the practice should occur 1-7 days prior to the CDR assessment, so in this case the CDR session will need to be rescheduled to ensure there is not a protocol deviation (i.e. the ppt is completing the practice test and CDR in the same day).

I will go ahead and cancel this CDR session now as it is less than 24 hours until the appointment, and please reschedule this CDR session to occur within the next 7 days.

If there is any way I could get a response by today at 5:30 EST, that would be helpful. Her next assessment is scheduled for that time, and if the practice test needs to be redone, I’ll need to reschedule that assessment with the rater.

Thank you for reaching out. Looking at both these subject ID’s created by CSC Nicki Whitely.

1052 = 31502
0968 = 31502.00

Subject ID 31502 has not yet been invited to myRCC. It appears that subject ID 31502.00 was invited to myRCC and the participant has not yet opened the invitation. 
 

An email address cannot be re-used within the system, therefore please verify the email address used in subject 31502.00 is NOT the email address the participant would like to use in the study. 

If it is the email address is indeed the one the participant would like to utilize –

1.	Re-send the email to the participant via myRCC page in the system (shown below as the green check, selecting this will open the invite page)
 
2.	Ensure the participant is using the email address/username exactly how it was entered on this page (usernames/emails are case sensitive, therefore they must match exactly what was invited)
3.	Update subject ID 31502 to TEST31502 to identify this one is not for use (for our data management team)
4.	Then you may update ID 31502.00 to the correct format 31502.
5.	Generate the Practice test in the system for the participant under 31502.


If the email address is not the address the participant would like to use –

1.	Update subject ID 31502.00 to TEST31502 to identify as a chart not to be used for our data management team.
2.	Invite subject ID 31502 to myRCC using whatever email address the participant would like to use
3.	Ensure the participant is using the email address/username exactly how it was entered on this page (usernames/emails are case sensitive, therefore they must match exactly what was invited)
4.	Generate the Practice test in the system for the participant under 31502.

Please let us know if we can provide any additional information regarding this.

Delaney

Subject: Login difficulties with Cogstate Site#20650 Subject#41593

Good morning,

Yesterday subject made multiple unsuccessful attempts to login to her Cogstate account to begin the practice run. She reset her password at least 4times and we were still unable to get her in the account. Can you please confirm if the account was successfully made in Cogstate (41593) and also please advise if she is locked out, if so can the account be unlocked for her to create another password for access? Thank you in advance!

I investigated the data received for this participant. It appears the participant closed the battery before completing the rest of the assessments. I do see data was collected through FNAME and BPSO, there are four more sets of tests past this section. The next section will begin with practice “yes” and “no”, I think the participant most likely thought they had completed and gone back to the beginning. 

Unfortunately, the participant will need to redo the whole assessment to complete all the necessary practice portions. 

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Best,
Delaney

  Eric Jones Message   Hey, this is Eric and I ran across cogstate.com a few
minutes ago.

Looks great… but now what?

By that I mean, when someone like me finds your website – either through Search
or just bouncing around – what happens next? Do you get a lot of leads from your
site, or at least enough to make you happy?

Honestly, most business websites fall a bit short when it comes to generating
paying customers. Studies show that 70% of a site’s visitors disappear and are
gone forever after just a moment.

Here’s an idea…

How about making it really EASY for every visitor who shows up to get a personal
phone call you as soon as they hit your site…

You can –

Talk With Web Visitor is a software widget that’s works on your site, ready to
capture any visitor’s Name, Email address and Phone Number. It signals you the
moment they let you know they’re interested – so that you can talk to that lead
while they’re literally looking over your site.

CLICK HERE https://boostleadgeneration.com to try out a Live Demo with Talk With
Web Visitor now to see exactly how it works.

You’ll be amazed - the difference between contacting someone within 5 minutes
versus a half-hour or more later could increase your results 100-fold.

It gets even better… once you’ve captured their phone number, with our new SMS
Text With Lead feature, you can automatically start a text (SMS) conversation.

That way, even if you don’t close a deal right away, you can follow up with text
messages for new offers, content links, even just “how you doing?” notes to
build a relationship.

Pretty sweet – AND effective.

CLICK HERE https://boostleadgeneration.com to discover what Talk With Web
Visitor can do for your business.

You could be converting up to 100X more leads today!

The participant can reset their account by selecting the “Forgot Password?” at the lower right of the login screen. This option works even if the participant has their account locked due to too many failed login attempts. 

It sounds the error message the participant was receiving is because they did not create a strong enough password for the account, password requirements below:

•	One special character 
•	One number 
•	One capital letter
•	At minimum 8 characters long

Hi Satoru,

Which user is trying to make edits to the CFT on the Clinical ink tablet? 

If there is no pencil (also, the title in the visit matrix will be italics), it means that the user’s role does not allow them to edit the form.

Once I know the user’s name I can check their role and confirm this.

Best,
Malia

Subject: I5T-MC-AACM: Confirmation Request for Cognitive Function Test Part 2 (Due Date: 24-Jan-2023)

Dear whom it may concerns,

I am Satoru Ohara of CRA who is in charge of Site #22450 in Protocol I5T-MC-AACM.
I contacted you to request confirmation for Cognitive Function Test Part II.
The site is scheduled to operate the corresponding test on the 25-Jan-2023, so please answer by the 24-Jan-2023.

Currently, the Site Rater screen is as shown below.
 

When the site staff select “Subject Attestation”, it will look like the figure below.
 

Originally, we think that a pencil mark will be displayed on the upper left side as shown in the figure below (excerpt from the manual), and the site staff/patient will be able to edit it.
 

Question 1
Does the fact that the pencil mark is not visible on the Rater screen and cannot be edited means that it is not visible on the Rater side because it is a page that the subject signs?
Also, is it possible for the subject to sign?
This appears as the form cannot be edited by the user who has the form open. Confirmation of user’s permissions will come from the Clinical Ink team (I’m tagging @Malia Schroeder please let me know if I should direct this to another individual). If the instruction in the job is different from what steps the user takes to edit, I’m adding in @obrien_christen_anne@lilly.com to confirm those changes need to take place. 23Jan23 DT
I understand that the user may not have permission to edit the form.
Could you please check the username that has been sent to Malia.
Also, if the user doesn't have permission to edit, could you please tell me how to deal with it on 25-Jan-2023?
Please let me know if there is an additional user role or if there is a user with authority on Site 22450. (24Jan2023, SO)

Question 2
As shown in the figure below, the CRF title: Start Cogstate Self-administered Cognitive Function Test (Practice) is in the pre-start status, is this a problem?
If there is a problem, how can we fix it?
This participant was administered the Cog. Part I events at the practice visit instead of the practice visit test. Per sponsor recommendation, the data is to be moved from V2_Rater Administered (Participant) to Practice. Our data management team is pending a query response to finish this work (I’ve included the query text below). A query notification was sent to the Chiho Murakami with a link to answer the query directly. DT 23Jan23

Dear Sir/Madam

I kindly would like your help with my Cogstate access. When I try to login in my account, it asks me to press “Forgot password”, but when I follow that path, the system doesn’t recognize my username.(Please see below). I have tried using my email with capitals also (PerezC@centralclinicalservices.com) , but it doesn’t recognize it as well.

I beg your urgent attention to this matter, as I have a patient on the phone right now, and visits scheduled on this week.

Thanks in advance for your reply,

Subject: [EXTERNAL] RE: Subject #31502/Site #17650 Unable to register via Cogstate 
 
	EXTERNAL EMAIL: Use caution before replying, clicking links, and opening attachments. 

Hi Nicki,
 
Thank you for reaching out. Can you please clarify a couple of items below?
 
1.	Which account has listed the email address the participant would like to use? (31502 or 31502.01?) Please do not reply with any PII.
2.	Did the participant search their inbox for an email from noreply@redcapcloud.com? 
a.	Participant account 31502.01 was successfully invited, though the participant never opened the invitation (see below). 
b.	You can verify if the participant has opened the invite on the myREDCapCloud page within RCC.
 
It is never Cogstate recommendation to delete subject profiles within the system, as this is an EDC and therefore data cannot be removed. Additionally, once an email address has been invited, the email cannot be used again in the trial as it is linked to that subject ID.
 
To troubleshoot:
 
•	Have the participant search their inbox for the myRCC invite for subject 31502.01 (this can also be resent under the myREDCapCloud). The email will come from noreply@redcapcloud.com
•	Note the email address/username must be entered exactly as it was entered on the myREDCapCloud page. The username is capital sensitive and therefore will not recognize an email with caps v. no caps etc.
o	Sometimes the participant study tablets capitalized the first letter of the email on the login page, ensure this is not occurring. 
 
I apologize your having trouble reaching us via phone. To ensure you are received, please always call the Cogstate mainline (203 773 5010) as calling direct personnel numbers may direct you to the team members voicemail instead of re-routing. 
 
Best,
Delaney

Subject: Subject #31502/Site #17650 Unable to register via Cogstate 
 
Good afternoon,
 
I need assistance with registering subject#31502 via Cogstate. This is my 4th attempt trying to get the subject registered to begin her Practice run, but again I am unsuccessful. I am currently conducting the visit right now and Cogstate recognizes her email address, but wont allow her to request for a reset. Once she enters her email or phone, a message is received that the system does not recognize the account. I made a new account to enter a different email address and Cogstate would not allow an invitation to be sent because the system advises that the email is already linked to a Cogstate account. The previous accounts were deleted by Cogstate, but the email addresses are still attached. I tried calling for support, but I am unable to speak to anyone. Can Cogstate register this subject? Or can Cogstate send a link for registration directly to the subject to register? Why wont Cogstate allow the subject to self register? I am trying to think critically about alternatives to resolve this issue. Can someone from Cogstate login remotely to my portal to view what I am seeing to support me? Can you please advise? We cant get any further with the appt until this is resolved. Thank you!

Thank you for providing. The Cogstate battery is not able to launch when the participants device is in portrait mode (vertical). It can only launch when the participant tablet is turned on its side in landscape mode (horizontal) this can be verified by the power button being on the side versus the bottom of the tablet.

Hello,
I have been trying to complete subject 34730 practice test but the subject gets an error when they try to open the practice test in RCC, it says that the assessment cannot be loaded.
We have tried everything we can think of to get it to work, they have even tried the study partners tablet and got the same message.
I know the subject has tried to call the support line and has not been able to reach anyone.
The subject is scheduled for the practice test again on 1/27/23 and we need to get this issue resolved.
The subject has tried to shut down and restart the tablet, but it made no difference.

Your assistance is appreciated.

Hi Colleen,
 
The email is linked to the subject number and Cogstate ID (i.e. if you change the subject number after you have put in the email, that email will still be associated with that account). 
 
With that, the email will be associated with whatever site number the subject number is linked to currently. 
 
I think the best step is to verify each email is associated with the correct subject IDs. If they are, then the emails will be linked to that site.

Hi Delaney,
 
Thank you for this! I will have her try the forgot password option. When she logs in will it automatically direct her to the right site even though the email was sent when she was attached to the wrong site?
 
 Thank you,

Hi both,
 
Apologies for jumping in here. 
 
It sounds like the two issues below – (now that the subjects are at the correct sites)
 
Subject 34466 needs the year of birth changed from 1957 to 1956 - @Hannah Obasoro I’m not sure if this requires a query, I would look to you for expertise. 
 
Subject 31489, is the email address listed for this subject the correct address? If so, it sounds like the participant has already opened the email sent to them. Once the subject opens the original invite, the resend link will disappear. The participant can update/get into their account by placing their username (email) into myRCC on the tablet and selecting “Forgot Password?”. This will send them an account reset link.
 
Please let me know if this solution makes sense and covers the problem completely.
 
Best,
Delaney

Subject: Re: [EXTERNAL] RE: AACM Subject under wrong site
 
Hi Hannah,
 
The problem with this solution is that subject 34466 belongs to site 21950, not 20100.  I can change 34466 back to 31489 at site 21950, but then it will be under both sites. 31489 is correctly registered under 20100, but the email invite won't work. I don't have another subject to register for 20100 at this time.
 
 Thank you,

Hi Colleen,
 
Thank you for your email. Since it appears the invite is already associated with the original subject record, might I suggest the following to remedy the issue:
1.     Kindly “undo” the change of subject IDs:
a.     Please do this by updating subject ID 34466 to 31489 and vice versa. This means that subject 34466 will now appear under site 20100 as it originally was, and subject 31489 will appear under site 21950.
2.     After the subject ID updates have been made, then I can go in the database and correct the site IDs as originally planned. This way subject 31489 would still be linked to the original account created where the invite had already been sent.  I can also assist with having the subject demographics updated as needed. 
 
Please let me know as soon as the subject IDs have been switched so we can proceed with correcting their site IDs.
 
Thank you,
Hannah

Subject: Re: [EXTERNAL] RE: AACM Subject under wrong site
 
Hi Hannah,
 
I hope I didn't mess it up too bad, but I went ahead and changed the subject ID to a different subject I was going to have to add to site 21950 soon anyway.  So now it shows subject 34466 under site 21950 and subject 31489 under site 20100, but there are two other issues now.  Subject 34466 needs the year of birth changed from 1957 to 1956.  Subject 31489 needs a new invite to join RCC, but when I go to invite her under the correct site it says the email is already associated with an account and won't let me resend the invite.  Thank you for any help you can provide for this.
 
 Thank you,

Thanks for looping me in Delaney.
 
Hi Colleen,
 
I can assist with updating the subject’s site ID to the correct one. A query will be issued shortly to have you confirm the site change. Kindly review and respond to this query at your earliest convenience. Once we receive a response, we can proceed with moving the subject from site 21950 to 20100.
 
Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions.

Thank you for letting us know. I’m looping in our data manager here. @Hannah Obasoro can you confirm if a formal DCF/query will needed to change the site number? It appears the CSC is not able to move the subject between sites.

Hi Katie,
 
Unfortunately, the only page that allows me to edit anything doesn't have the site number listed. The screenshot below doesn't have an edit.  When you click on the subject number it shows the demographics and no edit.  When you click the cogstate ID you can edit information but the site number is not an option.  I can change the subject to a different subject number for site 21950, but it won't allow me to change the year of birth. If I change the subject ID, can you help change the birth year? Then I should be able to add subject 31489 to the correct site.
 
 Thank you,

Subject: I5T-MC-AACM - Site 16150/Subject 34376 - V2 Self Administered Assessments Issue
Importance: High

Hello,

Subject 34376 from site 16150 had the Cognitive Testing Part 2 session today, January 10th. Subject’s tablet was running a bit slower than normal but subject was still able to launch the battery. Subject worked through each assessment, with the last one being the Face-Name test, but at the end subject just had a loading screen. We waited 5 or so minutes for the assessments to submit, but had no luck. I had subject check her Wi-Fi and we realized it had disconnected. The Wi-Fi router was restarted and tablet eventually reconnected to the Wi-Fi. Once connected, subject still had the loading screen and then the Cogstate app eventually logged her out. I had subject log back in and the V2 Self-Administered assessment was still marked as “Not Started”.

I am assuming this issue was a result of the lost Wi-Fi connection at some point during the assessment and unfortunately the assessments did not successfully submit. Are you able to confirm on your end that the assessments were completed? Can the data be backed up or will the assessment need to be repeated.

Please advise on next steps. Thank you!

Thank you for clarifying. From the screenshot provided below, it would appear the participant device is not presenting in landscape mode. 

If the participant puts it in portrait orientation, instruct to pick up and rotate until it’s correct. Note: The participant must pick up the tablet to rotate it and not rotate it on the surface. 

I’ve included a screenshot of what the device should look like in landscape/horizontal mode. 

 

Kind Regards,
Delaney

Yes, I can confirm that the patient was NOT holding the tablet and the tablet was placed on a desk near the modem, with the button facing the side. Thank you so much for your quick response.

Hi Nicki,
 
Thanks for the feedback, could you also just confirm In addition, the ppt is holding the study tablet horizontally (with button to the side) and is keeping it in this position (e.g. by laying it flat on the table)? It is important that when the ppt does open and complete the test, the tablet remains in this position as turning the tablet during the test can cause the test to close down.
 
This is helpful to troubleshoot.
 
Thank you!
 
Kerry




Hi Nicki,

Thanks for reaching out. I just checked the status of the practice test on RCC and can confirm it appears unopened. Could you please confirm that the ppt has checked the tablet is connected to the Wifi and has a strong connection (e.g. is close to the router). Often the test will not open if the Wifi connection is too weak or keeps cutting out. In addition, could you please confirm that the ppt is holding the study tablet horizontally (with button to the side) and is keeping it in this position (e.g. by laying it flat on the table)? It is important that when the ppt does open and complete the test, the tablet remains in this position as turning the tablet during the test can cause the test to close down.

Good afternoon,

I am requesting technical support for the above subject's tablet/Cogstate profile. The subject was unable to complete the Practice Run as it would not load. I coached the subject on several troubleshooting methods, but nothing has worked to load the Practice Run. The subject's tablet IMEI# 358590101123212. The tablet was rebooted twice and the subject was advised to keep the tablet on the power source. Can you please assist? Thank you!"

In RCC, there is no participant under this ID number at site 15050. We show a 34979-participant number who has completed their practice test. Can you please confirm if these are the same participant?

Hi Michelle,

I hope this email finds you well. I’m just reaching out as I was processing the new bookings this morning and noticed that you have booked 4 split CDR appts for ppt 42779 on 24th January. I can see two of these are with Nana, one with Zahra and one with Aaron. I am going to go ahead and cancel the appts with Zahra and Aaron as the split CDRs need to occur with the same rater, so it makes sense to keep the two with Nana. 

In future, please use the cancel or edit/reschedule function on your booking confirmation to rearrange any appts, rather the creating new ones. This means that the appointments on rater calendars  can be used for other participants. Please reach out if you need any assistance in this or have any other queries.

I have started a new email chain here which does not contain the participants email address (PII). Please note we will be deleting the previous email threads to remove the PII from our systems per our agreement with Lilly.

“The above subject is having issues with registering with Cogstate. I believe it may be becuase her profile was attached to an incorrect email invitation that was sent to another participant in error. The invitation link was sent to ****** via the cogstate portal at least 4 times. Each time, the participant was not given the option to enter her name and create a pw. The system requested her email and/or phone as if an account was already created.
 
Can I request to have her profile deleted in cogstate and I re-enter the info again with the correct email address? I tried to re-enter the data, but the system would not allow as the subject ID was duplicate. Thanks in advance!”


You can create another participant profile for this participant in RCC with the email address. First you will need to edit the current subject ID to “test31502”. Once this has been done, you can create a new subject ID under 30456 and attempt to register the other email address. I included some screenshots below.
 
Select Cogstate ID for the participant number
 
Select Edit in the top right
 
Now you will be able to edit the subject number. Update the previous subject number to Test31502 and proceed with the normal steps to create subject 31502 again in the system.

Please let us know if you have any questions.

Delaney

Hi Nicki,
 
Thanks for the feedback, could you also just confirm In addition, the ppt is holding the study tablet horizontally (with button to the side) and is keeping it in this position (e.g. by laying it flat on the table)? It is important that when the ppt does open and complete the test, the tablet remains in this position as turning the tablet during the test can cause the test to close down.
 
This is helpful to troubleshoot.
 
Thank you!
 
Kerry

Goodmorning,
 
We tried again today to complete the practice test, utilizing the specific instructions that were forwarded in the previous email and this attempt was unsuccessful as well. I also advised the subject to reboot her modem, refresh her wifi signal/connection and leave the tablet plugged in while attempting to access the practice test. None of these tactics worked as she is still getting the error message I mentioned in the previous email. Please see below screenshot of the error message she continues to receive each time she tries to access the test. Please advise. Thank you!

Hi Nicki,
 
Thanks for reaching out. I just checked the status of the practice test on RCC and can confirm it appears unopened. Could you please confirm that the ppt has checked the tablet is connected to the Wifi and has a strong connection (e.g. is close to the router). Often the test will not open if the Wifi connection is too weak or keeps cutting out. In addition, could you please confirm that the ppt is holding the study tablet horizontally (with button to the side) and is keeping it in this position (e.g. by laying it flat on the table)? It is important that when the ppt does open and complete the test, the tablet remains in this position as turning the tablet during the test can cause the test to close down.

Good afternoon,
 
I am requesting technical support for the above subject's tablet/Cogstate profile. The subject was unable to complete the Practice Run as it would not load. I coached the subject on several troubleshooting methods, but nothing has worked to load the Practice Run. The subject's tablet IMEI# 358590101123212. The tablet was rebooted twice and the subject was advised to keep the tablet on the power source. Can you please assist? Thank you!

direct my inquiry to the following group   Industry-Sponsored Clinical Trials My
inquiry is regarding   User Support Inquiry What is the name of your study?  
Eric Jones Message   Hey there, I just found your site, quick question…

My name’s Eric, I found cogstate.com after doing a quick search – you showed up
near the top of the rankings, so whatever you’re doing for SEO, looks like it’s
working well.

So here’s my question – what happens AFTER someone lands on your site? Anything?

Research tells us at least 70% of the people who find your site, after a quick
once-over, they disappear… forever.

That means that all the work and effort you put into getting them to show up,
goes down the tubes.

Why would you want all that good work – and the great site you’ve built – go to
waste?

Because the odds are they’ll just skip over calling or even grabbing their
phone, leaving you high and dry.

But here’s a thought… what if you could make it super-simple for someone to
raise their hand, say, “okay, let’s talk” without requiring them to even pull
their cell phone from their pocket?

You can – thanks to revolutionary new software that can literally make that
first call happen NOW.

Talk With Web Visitor is a software widget that sits on your site, ready and
waiting to capture any visitor’s Name, Email address and Phone Number. It lets
you know IMMEDIATELY – so that you can talk to that lead while they’re still
there at your site.

You know, strike when the iron’s hot!

CLICK HERE https://boostleadgeneration.com to try out a Live Demo with Talk With
Web Visitor now to see exactly how it works.

When targeting leads, you HAVE to act fast – the difference between contacting
someone within 5 minutes versus 30 minutes later is huge – like 100 times
better!

That’s why you should check out our new SMS Text With Lead feature as well… once
you’ve captured the phone number of the website visitor, you can automatically
kick off a text message (SMS) conversation with them.

Imagine how powerful this could be – even if they don’t take you up on your
offer immediately, you can stay in touch with them using text messages to make
new offers, provide links to great content, and build your credibility.

Just this alone could be a game changer to make your website even more
effective.

Strike when the iron’s hot!

CLICK HERE https://boostleadgeneration.com to learn more about everything Talk
With Web Visitor can do for your business – you’ll be amazed.

Thanks and keep up the great work!

There are two different portals for the Red Cap Cloud, one is the participant portal (which it sounds like you are logging into) with an address as: https://myrcc.login.redcapcloud.com/

The other portal is for your laptop, this is where you can create participants, etc.: https://cogstate.login.redcapcloud.com/#cid=nph2020&act=list&studyId=2307

The tablet is pre-configured to have the participant portal set as your login screen. Please use the above link to the administrative portal where you can add participants, invite them, answer queries. 

Your username for both portals is likely the same, the links will be different though as seen above.

Best,
Delaney

Hi,
 
The participant did the reset on the tablet, it stated the email was not associated with the account. The participant tried the email that is associated with 28854.0, and it told them to click on the invite that was sent to them on 12/06/2022. The participant has tried all of the step several times and has not been successful.

Hi Shauna,
 
The participant will then need to do the “Forgot Password?” option on the tablet to reset their account. Even if the account has superseded the amount of password attempts, this will still reset their account. The email will come in from noreply@redcapcloud.com 
 
Once the participant has opened the original invite email, the invitation cannot be resent. The account can only be reset through a password reset email.
 
After creating the new password, when the participant goes to login to the ensure the device is not capitalizing the first letter of the password.

Delaney

Hi Shauna,

I have raised the removal of subjects 28854.1 and 28854.3 in RCC with our data manager so you should receive emails to clear these. 

Regarding the password reset - have you navigated to the green tick on the far right of the subject, clicked here and resent the invitation to the participant?

 

If not, please try this step first and ask ppt to check their emails including junk/spam.

Please also ask the ppt to check that their username or password is not being capitalized on the log in, e.g. if they are using their smart phone sometimes it auto-corrects what the participant enters with a capital letter and that will mean the ppt is unable to log in as these are caps sensitive.

Failing this, please ask the participant to use the ‘Forgot my password’ on the study tablet and go through the steps as prompted on the tablet to create a new password with which they can log in from.

Please reach out if you require any further assistance.

Subject: 28854

Good Morning,

Subject 28854 has been having trouble logging into cogstate with the email and password they created. I have gone through all the steps, but the account is locked because they made a password before and could not get into the system. I created two more versions by mistake to try and help them get into the system. Can you please remove accounts 28854.1 and 28854.2? The subject will need to have the account reset so I can send out a new invite for them to create a new password to get into the system. 

Warm Regards,

The practice test is completed but not passed. It needs to be both completed and passed to enable us to provide you with live access to sites in RCC.

To re-do the practice test, you’ll need to log back into your PC first and click into the subject on RCC, and select ‘Unmark as Complete’ (as my colleague Delaney shows below). Once you’ve done this, you’ll be able to go back to the tablet and re-do the practice test. We will notify you if you have successfully passed or not once this is complete, and provide the live access if appropriate.

Many thanks,

Hi Sulen,

If the user has marked the practice as complete in the Cogstate eSource Platform, the test will need to be marked as uncomplete before proceeding to re-launch. I have included screenshots below. 

 
Navigate to subject ID
 
Select the first CRF (Begin Cogstate Self-Administered Cognitive Tests (Practice Run) 
 
Select “Unmark as Complete”

This will allow the test supervisor to re-launch the battery on the study tablet. 

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Best,

Dear Robert 

I am kindly following up on this. Site was advised initially advised by the
agent as below;
-- > Cogstate informed that the issue that you are having is due to the cables
are not connected since the beginning into the device. They advise to connect
the cables even before you turn on the device. Please try this and let us know
if the problems still persist .

SC replied;
--> I explained for several Times that plugging in the cables before starting
the device is not possible because than I am not able to enter data with text

Site: W01-DE10004 - Cogstate Battery - Error Launching Battery

 

Message:

 



Hello Andrea Hernandez,

 

Thank you for contacting Cogstate for additional support.

 

For Cogstate to best support you and the site, please provide as much detail as
possible when escalating support tickets.

 * What is the Subject ID and Visit timepoint?
   
   
 * Can you confirm that the site followed proper guidance when connecting the
   testing equipment?
   * The ‘No’ External Response Button plugged into port 1 of the White Response
     Box.
   * The ‘Yes’ External Response Button plugged into port 2 of the White
     Response Box.
   * The White Response Box plugged into the testing device via USB.

 

Tip: You can have the sites check to see if the buttons are responding before
they even sign in to the CeP.

After connecting the equipment, have them click inside the text field where they
type their username. Then, have them press each External Response Button. If
done correctly, they should see letters appear in the text field after each
press.



 * Can you elaborate on what exactly happens during these crashes?
   * Do any error messages appear?
   * Does the testing device power off?
   * Does the user get logged out of their CeP account?
   * Do they always get sent to the same screen with each “crash”?
   * Can the site provide any pictures, videos, or screenshots of this event?
     
     

 * Do you know if the user is accidentally marking the ""1. Begin Cogstate
   Battery"" form as complete before clicking the [Begin Assessment] button?

 * Sometimes staff will enter their subject's DOB and accidentally click the
   ""Save and Exit"" button in the upper right corner instead of ""Begin
   Assessment."" Clicking [Save and Exit] instead of [Begin Assessment] will mark
   the ""1. Begin Cogstate Battery"" form as complete, which prohibits the
   Cogstate Battery from launching. Fortunately, if they accidentally do this,
   have them open the ""1. Begin Cogstate Battery"" form and click the [Unmark as
   Complete] button where [Save and Exit] was in the upper right corner.

 

 * Last, would you please describe what troubleshooting steps were attempted
   with the site?

 

Best regards,

Robert Bartholomew

I would like to inform we have this site with an issue after they have started
the assesment, they have entered the date of birth of the patient and reach the
point to connect the cables to the tablet. As soon as the cables are connected
the system crash and get her back to the first screen where the study
coordinator has to log in. 

We try several times and always reach the same point. Please advise what needs
to be done as they have several patients comming and they are missing this
assesment

Our central rater alerted us participant 16150-15431 is having trouble logging in. Can I confirm a couple of items with you?

To confirm, the error the participant gets is “incorrect password” when they attempt to login? 
•	If this is the case and the participant has previously been able to login, please ensure the tablet is not capitalizing the first letter of the participants new password. 
•	Is the participant only experiencing this login issue on the study tablet? I.e. not when they login to change their password?
For a locked account:
•	The reset/unlock for the account is the same as if the participant forgot their password
o	They will just need to select the “Forgot Password?” on the lower right-hand side of the login screen. 

If the participant is only experiencing this on the tablet and they have previously successfully logged in, please conduct the password reset and have the participant set the password to something simple (i.e. Password123!) to verify they are able to login. This can be changed after the participant verifies, they can login. Typically, we see the problem stated below when the tablet has capitalized the first letter of the password and that is not how the password was entered when created. 


Best,
Delaney"

Subject: 10750-34554

I need some assistance with this participant. We set up her account at the unboxing visit. She tried logging in today and wasn't able to. She had to reset her password 3 different times before it would let her in. After the testing started, she got logged out and was unable to log back in. The rater had to end the session. I contacted the participant to reset her password and she has done it a couple of more times but not able to log in on her tablet. She's turned it off/on but nothing is working. She's locked out now. Any suggestions? Could someone unlock her account and send her a reset email?

I hope this email finds you well. I’m just reaching out regarding your recent reschedule with ppt 37241 as we noticed it was booked for 3.30am EST. Our rater does show availability on her calendar this time as she is based in Europe (9.30am start time for her) but we highly doubt you intended to book this session for so early on the 15th! Please let me know if you’d like to reschedule this session for 3.30pm EST as our rater Liam is available this time on the 15th and I can move the appointment to him.

Many thanks,

Katie

I hope this email finds you well. I’m just reaching out as I noticed on Friday you cancelled the study participant appointment with rater Ana for ppt 32417 and rebooked with Milse at 5.15pm today. Unfortunately split CDR’s have to be conducted with the same rater, so we will need to rearrange one of the sessions to ensure that we stay within protocol. May I suggest that we do a combined CDR session with both partner and participant starting at 5pm today with Milse (if study partner is available at this time)?

Please be aware that if the session with Ana goes ahead with study partner today at 1pm EST today, then the study participant portion will also need to be conducted with Ana within the next 3 days, and Ana’s availability is limited to the following sessions:

9am Tuesday 13th Dec
12.30pm Tuesday 13th Dec
10.30am Wednesday 14th Dec
2.30pm Wednesday 14th Dec

Please let me know ASAP if you would like me to move the study participant portion to one of these and cancel the participant session with Milse tonight.

Also please reach out if you would like me to cancel both sessions and reschedule.

Many thanks,
Katie

Apologies for jumping in. Please follow the steps below: 


You can create another participant profile for this participant in RCC with the email address. First you will need to edit the current subject ID to “test30456”. Once this has been done, you can create a new subject ID under 30456 and attempt to register the other email address. I included some screenshots below.

Select Cogstate ID for the participant number
 
Select Edit in the top right
 
Now you will be able to edit the subject number. Update the previous subject number to Test36893 and proceed with the normal steps to create subject 30456 again in the system.

Best,
Delaney

Hi Tarin,
 
Thank you for letting me know. I will raise with the data manager now to let them know we need this subject removed in RCC.
 
Kind regards,
 
Katie


Hi Tarin,

We have been in contact with RCC, who have confirmed an issue with the SMS texts being sent to participants yesterday, which is why the ppt never received this. They are currently looking into a fix, but in the meantime, they have said that due to the participant’s account not yet being verified, could you possibly navigate to the ppt’s account details again in RCC (under Cogstate ID), and try to remove the phone number, and then resend the invite to the ppt?

If this doesn’t work and ppt still doesn’t get an email, please let me know and I will ask the data manager to issue a query to remove the ppt from RCC (you’ll get an email notification to confirm) and once this is complete, you can go ahead and set up the ppt again in RCC, this time excluding a phone number.

Thanks for your patience with this! If you have any questions please let me know.

Kind regards,

Katie

Hi Tarin,
 
My apologies, could you hold fire on this just for now? There may be another avenue we can investigate on our end in which we’d be able to remove the original subject already entered into RCC. If this is the case, it would be preferable as it means that we’d be able to use the same email address as before (when a new subject is created then a new email address is needed).
 
Hope this makes sense and sorry for any confusion! Thanks again for your patience.
 
Many thanks,
 
Katie

Hi Tarin,

I have heard back from our tech support and they have suggested that the best workaround in this situation would be to create a ‘new’ subject in RCC using this participant, e.g. 30456.1, with which you can set up the participant again using an email address, this time excluding the use of a phone number in the creation of the account. 

Kind regards,

Katie

Hi Tarin, 

Thanks for your prompt response. One more thing to try then – could you please just check the phone number entered into RCC is correct by clicking on the Cogstate ID to the left of the subject number? You can amend this number on the participant’s profile if necessary to the correct/a different number that the participant uses. You can also resend the invite on RCC once this is done by clicking on the blue tick to the far right of the subject number and selecting ‘Re-send Invitation’ at the bottom of the screen.

 

 

Just a note too that deleting the number from the profile will not mean the participant will receive an email – unfortunately when a phone number is entered into the system it does override the email and the action of having entered a phone number cannot be undone. 

Please try the steps above as well as asking participants to double check their spam/junk folders just incase anything has landed in there. If there’s still no email/text, we can dig into it further on our end with tech support.

Kind regards,

Katie

Hi Tarin,

Thanks for reaching out. I can see in RCC that the subject’s account was created including a phone number, and this can cause the notification to be sent to the phone instead of the email. Could you please ask the participant to follow the text message link they should have received to this phone number to set up their account instead of the email normally received?

Please let me know if you need any further assistance.

Kind regards,

Thanks for reaching out. Could you please ensue the participant has the tablet horizontal (button to the side) and that it is not moved during the practice test as this can interrupt the test and cause forms to close out. The best way to do this is to keep the device flat on a surface for the duration of the test. 

Also please ensure the tablet is connected to WiFi as if the connection drops then this may cause the test to not continue. I can see the forms were opened and saved in RCC, suggesting a good WiFi connection in the beginning, but later parts of the test appear to be ‘unopened’ and so this may be where Wifi dropped.

Many thanks,

Katie

Please note, the participant should not be “creating” their own account. Participants should only be actioning/acting on an email reevied from noreply@redcapcloud.com after you have sent the invitation from RCC as seen below. 

You can resend the invitation by navigating to the RCC online portal, locating your subject number and selecting “myREDCapCloud” to the right of your subject number.

Thanks for reaching out. I can see both appointments on our booking calendar; I think the first appointment didn’t send a confirmation email as the email address entered into the booking was incorrect (missing the d):

langarica@centralclinicalservices.com

As we cannot amend the email address entered into bookings when an appointment is made, I’ve cancelled the first appointment you created at 12pm, and moved the 12.10pm appointment you booked second to a 12pm start. Please ensure when creating bookings in the future that you enter your correct centralclinicalservices.com email address, as unfortunately we cannot amend this on our end either.

Many thanks,

Katie

Subject: AACM Bookings Subject 22127 & 22127.1 Site 18900
Importance: High

Hello, 

I scheduled an appointment for a study participant and study partner for Cognitive Assessments Part 1 for December 8th twice one for 12:00 noon and another for 12:10 due to csc not receiving a confirmation. I am not sure if the first one was successfully scheduled. Due to the subject(s) conflicted schedule I submitted a second appt - when I also noticed I inadvertently listed the appointment as a Part 2 and not part 1 for Cognitive Assessment. I was wondering if you can confirm the appointment for 12:00 noon that has been set for subject(s) 22127 and 22127.1 site number 18900 for 12-8-22 at 12:00 noon is a go. 

If so, how do I cancel the duplicate appt I scheduled shortly after for 12:10 pst? 

My apologies for the inconvenience.

Warm regards,
Daisy Langarica

Hi there,

This ppt noted he has a meeting from 1-2pm PST today, but could meet between 2-3pm if anything is available in there.

He also noted availability tomorrow: 9am-11am, 11:30am-1pm and 2-3pm tomorrow. I am in another V2 at 2pm tomorrow, but can probably figure out a way to facilitate this if it is the best option!

Hi Erin,

Apologies, the rater had misunderstood and I confirmed with her today that it is not possible. As for alternative times today, the rater could be available at 4pm EST (1pm PST) if the ppt is available then? I anticipate this second part of the psychometric will only take around half an hour to complete.

Many thanks,

Katie

Hi Katie,

Thanks for the follow up. When I spoke with this rater directly last Friday she said 3pm PST tomorrow should be fine. Can you please confirm this is not possible? Otherwise I do not think the participant was available any earlier, so if you can provide alternate times for today or tomorrow that would be helpful.

Thank you for reaching out. I will go ahead and move this visit to new date and time. You will receive a confirmation email shortly. 

Since split psychometric sessions are not standard, they are not a bookable option.

Please send over an updated Zoom link, I think you can add 2 to the end of the naming convention to indicate the two parts.

Hi Delaney,

Rochelle requested I connect with you as this participant’s Cognitive Testing Part 1 was interrupted today partway through, as the power company (unexpectedly) came and shut his power off.

She just needs to administer the MoCa and CSSRS and there is not a “split” session option to select on Bookings. Can you please advise how you would like me to complete a booking request for this for 3pm PST on Tuesday, 12/6 (when Rochelle and the ppt are both confirmed as available)? And if there is any type of adjustment I need to make to the naming convention of the Zoom meeting?

Thank you very much!

Has this been raised with the trial capabilities team? We will need the SIP report to reflect the sites requiring access for our records.

Currently Cogstate has deployed access to the below sites based on the SIP report:

13400
18000
12902
12202

Please let me know if there are additional sites not listed here.

Subject: AACM site 15750 CSC access

Hi there,

There is an issue with SIP automation for a new CSC, Yocelyne Sanchez (CCed) for site 15750 and she is not populating on the ISR/access to systems is not triggering. This has been escalated to our IT teams here but in the interim, I am wondering if there is any way to have this site added to her access? I believe she already has site 18000 (same PI).

Thanks for any help you can provide!

HI Erin,

Our rater also noticed in RCC that this ppt hasn’t completed their practice test yet in RCC, which needs to be completed prior to the CDR on the 8th (at least the day before). After some investigating, I can see this participant was set up as ‘In-study’ instead of ‘Practice’, so the practice forms were not generated. Please navigate to the subjects screen and click on the Cogstate ID to the left of the subject number. Then select edit and change the status to ‘practice’, then save and exit. Then, on the subject screen again, select the subject ID this time and generate the practice form.

The ppt then needs to complete the practice test by 7th Dec latest (they don’t need to pass like you did in training, they just need to complete).

Many thanks,

Katie

Hi Erin,

Thanks for reaching out. Our rater Ashley is able to take this session next Friday. Could you please provide the following details and I can create the booking manually?

Hi Victoria,
 
Thanks for letting me know. I think there is some confusion regarding the psychometric part 2, as this does not need to be scheduled into bookings with the rater. There is only one Cognitive Testing session for the participant which needs to be scheduled with the rater (part 1) and part 2 is with the study partner/participant only. In light of this, would you like me to cancel the part 2 session on the 8th?
 
Kind regards,
Katie
 
Here are the appointments we are wanting to keep. I'm sorry for the confusion!  I am still trying to get access to Zoom through my company. 
 
06-Dec-2022 @ 11:15 (Study partner/ Study participant interview)

Warm regards,  
Victoria Aguilar 

Followed up with asking if any assistance needed on 30 Nov 22.

Good morning ! 

I never received the appointment confirmation emails,  is there a different way to cancel the visits that aren't needed? I am getting the zoom links for the visits as well! I am so sorry this was my first time scheduling and it was a little rough as you can tell. I appreciate any assistance ! next time around will be much better , I promise .

Hi Victoria,
 
My apologies, I have just seen you have also booked a combined CDR appointment on the 6th with rater Ana for this participant. In that case, could you please cancel the study partner session you have booked with Nana below? This will mean we have more appointments available for other CSCs to use. You can cancel by clicking in the link on the outlook confirmation (you received upon booking the session).
 
Also, I can see you have 2 psychometric sessions booked with rater Liam for this participant, on the 7th and 8th. Could you please cancel the appointment which is no longer needed? Liam has also let us know he has no zoom link for the session. Once you have cancelled the slot which is not needed, could you please create a zoom meeting link for the date/time of the booking you’d like to keep and add the link and passcode into the appointment details, so that our rater is able to join the session at the planned time.
 
Please reach out if you need any help or if you have any questions!
 
Many thanks,
 
Katie

Hi Victoria,
 
This is a reminder that a 2nd Study Participant portion of the CDR split assessment needs to be booked for within 36 hours for participant 21500-30001, V2. I can see the study partner portion has been booked for Dec 6th with Nana at 11am EST, and we strongly advise that the second appointment is booked as availability will decrease the closer we get to the appointment date. Due to study protocol stipulations, your session will need to take place with the same rater as your first CDR Study Partner portion, so the study participant portion will also need to be booked with Nana.

Thanks for reaching out about this. I just heard back from our wider team who have let me know that although we can’t combine two subjects into one, we can move data from one to the other. From what we can see, there is no assessment data captured under 19466.01 (everything is under 19466). Therefore, a data move is not required and the site just needs to make sure that they continue to select 19466 instead of 19466.01 when testing the subject to ensure everything is in the same place. If you would like us to remove 19466.01 so it no longer appears as an option then please let us know.

Hope you have a great day!

Many thanks,

Katie

No practice test launched,TrailBlazer3/AACM,Completed,Katie Shortland;Delaney Taylor;Member,11/28/2022,,11/29/2022,Katie Shortland,I5T-MC-AACM,myRCC,"CSC had set up ppt has 'in-study' rather than 'practice'. 

Hi Shauna,

I hope this email finds you well. I did some investigating on our end and can see that the ppt was set up as ‘in study’ on RCC, rather than ‘practice’, so therefore they cannot see the practice test. To amend this, navigate to RCC on your PC/laptop and select the Cogstate ID which is to the left of the subject number. Then, click on ‘edit’ in the top right of the screen and change the selection on the drop down menu to ‘practice’, then save and exit (again in top right).

 
 

Then, when back on the main subject screen, click on the subject ID this time and select ‘add event’ in the top right corner, and add practice test from the drop down menu. Again, save this. 

The participant should now be able to launch the practice test on their device.

Please let me know if you require any further assistance on this.

Kind regards,
Katie

Hi Jennifer,
 
This is regarding the same visit as below – our rater still cannot find the subject and ppt number in CI (although we understand the TICS was completed yesterday). Could you please confirm the subject number (i.e. we would like to ensure there was not a typo when scheduling etc)?
 
Many thanks,

Hi Jennifer,

I’m just reaching out regarding your CDR sessions with ppt 19000-30238, V2 this afternoon. I can see that the split CDR sessions were booked with different raters so I’m just reaching out to let you know that I moved the study participant portion to also be with Aaron (instead of Nana as originally booked). The session will still be going ahead at exactly the same time (3.45pm EST) and the study partner session at 2.15pm EST is unchanged and is still with Aaron.  

I also enclose the excerpt from excerpt from the Manual of Operations for future appointments below.

First, it is preferred that a CDR combined session is booked, and that the split CDR sessions are made only when this is impossible. 

Second, if the split CDR sessions are required, then both the study partner and study participant portions must be conducted with the same rater.

•	Cogstate Battery practice session must occur at least 1 day and no more than 7 days prior to the Study Partner CDR interview.
•	The CDR Rating session must occur prior to the psychometric Part I rating session.

•	CDR Rating Combined Session 90mins
o	To preserve data collection, It is ALWAYS preferred   to use a combined CDR session (study partner and participant). 

•	If a combined CDR session is not feasible (emergency cases):
•	The Study Partner portion MUST occur before the Study Participant portion and both sessions MUST occur within 4 calendar days of each other. Please book both sessions at the onset to ensure these strict time lines are adhered to.
•	First, CDR Study Partner Session 45mins
•	Second, CDR Study Participant Session 45mins
•	Psychometric Rating Combined Session 90mins
o	This visit cannot be split and must be conducted in one session. This rating is to conduct the Part I for the study participant 
•	The study partner and participant should be informed of the ratings total booked time (i.e. the participant and partner should plan on the rating lasting 90mins 

If you have any further questions please let me know.

Kind regards,

Katie

Subject: TICS checked out and not checked back in for patient

Hello, 

I am trying to ensure patient 21561 has all assessments completed, before they undergo infusion, but I am not seeing their TICS score.  I see that someone checked out TICS-m back in May, but the forms were never checked back in.   The person who checked the forms out is not on our team, but event personnel.

Is there any way to retrieve charts the participant’s TICS-m score?

Thank you,

The tablet may be capitalizing the first letter or number in the password, just to be mindful when the participant goes to login. 

Best,
Delaney

Subject: Patient locked out due to too many password requests

Hello, 

I was working with patient 22892 to set up their RedCap Cloud account.  The patient logged in on their telephone, singed out, then tried logging in on their tablet.  The patient stated they tried entering their new password on the tablet, but the password would not take.   The patient is now locked out due to too  many attempts. 

Do we need to wait a specific time, or does this need a different reset to get the patient access?

Thank you,
Maria

Cogstate Battery Test: One Back (ONB)

Description of Issue:
Cogstate Science was alerted that the default thresholds for completion or performance criteria have been crossed for this study.

The Science team found that multiple subject visits with low accuracy scores allowed about half of the total ONB responses to max out. Additionally, several other participants permitted this test to max out entirely.

Action(s):
(17Oct2022) As we are seeing a large amount of MaxOuts in ONB for this study, thus causing elevated rates of performance failure, Cogstate emailed all applicable Test Supervisors to review the rules of the test and ensure they are watching participants closely. -RB

(17Nov2022) Thus far, only one staff at the site responded and says that they haven't noticed any issues. Closing ticket. -RB"

Thank you for reaching out. You will need to reach out to support@clinicalink.com with this inquiry. I believe they have been having some issues with the forms populating within the participant charts. Unfortunately, since Cogstate does not manage the Clinical Ink system for this study, you will need to raise this directly with them.

Please let me know if we can be of assistance or if you have any questions.

Hello,

Today I completed the SP questionnaire first and then completed the Subjects questionnaire. The SP completed the questionnaire for her portion; however, I noticed below that there is no green circle next to the SP forms and when I click on the form individually, they are all blank. I also noticed there are 2 open queries. Does that have something to do with the SP information not being saved/quiries? 

Thanks,

The percentage bar does not indicate completion of the all the tests within the Cogstate Battery, but if the CRFs are marked as complete or open. 

You can see the test was completed by the paper icon next to the 2. Cogstate Battery Assessment Confirmation (rater).

The percent completion may be open due to data management queries or additional notes being added to the visit. If any action is required, our data manager will reach out with a query.

Hi Tracy,
 
I show you are still pending the practice test to finish your training for Cogstate. Until the Applied Training practice session is completed and passed, you will not have live access to administer to participants within the trial. 
 
I show the last practice test was taken 15Jun22 and was unsuccessful. This was under the mock subject ID “TestTR”. I do show the battery was open in Aug., 2022 but the actual tests were not retaken.
 
Please retake the practice tests under “TestTR” at your earliest convenience for our review.
 
Thank you,
Delaney

This was a great refresher, although I did all of these step's months ago.  I have pt.'s that I need to do TIC's with and the other Cognitive tests.  I am not sure what I am missing, but I am obviously missing something.

Please let me know if this helps clear up any confusion. The important troubleshooting piece as recommended below is to ensure the device is in the proper orientation prior to launching the battery, the battery will only launch in landscape/horizontal mode.

Dear all,

Thank you for your kind support for my training.
I have heard from the Japan CRA that a study coordinator at other study site (Nishi-umeda clinic) completed this test on the CRC device, not the patient's device. Since they are using the same tablet as I am, I am wondering I am assuming I can complete this test with my SurfacePro as well.
I am sorry, but could you please let me know again on the procedure, as my settings may be wrong. If possible, it would be very helpful if you could attach a screenshot regarding the setup.

Hi Kathleen, 
Device request need to be sent through Clinical Ink, but before I make any request for devices, can someone please explain why it is needed?  I cannot quite decipher that from the email string below.  Correct me if I’m wrong, but there has never been a device restriction for training completion.  We also have a limited number of tablets available at the moment.  We have 10 set aside for rater use, but outside of that we do not have enough participant tablets to send to additional study personnel.  Is Koga-san part of the rater pool?

I also noted that the IMIE number couldn’t be located on the Surface tablet.  Please check under the stand flap as it is often underneath.  
Thanks, 
Christy

Hello Christy,

I’m hoping I’m pointing everyone in the correct direction, but can you help assist with procuring a participant device (Android tablet) for Koga-san to facilitate completion on their Applied training (i.e, for the Cogstate cognitive tests).  Currently they were attempting to complete their mock practice test on the SC device.  Apologies if I should direct coordination elsewhere - please let me know; otherwise, thank you for your help.

Hi Sanae,

The participant provided tablet is the Android Atab-1. The Cogstate battery has device specifications to ensure the device will properly capture data responses and will not launch on another device.

I have looped in our project manager to assist with escalations to the Lilly team to ensure the correct device is provided.

You can edit this subject ID to include “test” in the name for our data team to identify as a mock subject ID. You can do this by editing the page under “Cogstate ID” and selecting edit in the top right corner. 

Please edit the subject ID to include “test” and save the changes. This will make the account a mock profile. You will then be able to create the subject again with their real subject ID and correct email address under the same site number.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Best,

I replied to the queries. Let me know if you have questions. I also have another error to report. An attempt on the account for site 18750 subject ID 24895 decided they wanted to switch emails and I was unable to edit their original account due to them having already made a redcap account. I need the cogstate ID 0703 deleted or moved to test site for site 18750 please. Thank you.

In this particular instance the CSC and rater verified TeamViewer at start of visit but by the time they progressed to the MoCA the tablet updated to the incorrect version.   I understand that CSC was informed to contact CI and the continued appointment to be re-scheduled; I’m assuming CI Support would have details on the device at this time and perhaps resolution but again wanting to make you aware for any follow-up you need.

The email below stated the CDR was done on 31Oct22, apologies for not understanding which form you were referencing. 

The Rater Administered form was marked as complete today:
 

The dates listed on the subject matrix are projected dates for the next visit to occur based on when the visit before them was populated.

The CSC will need to add the “Self-Administered (Participant)” assessment by “Add Event” on the subject events page. 

 

Since the rater does not have access to the self-administered form, they will not generate those forms for the participant.

Please let me know if this clarifies things.

So, I assume the date doesn't have to be the exact date they are taking the assessment either then, as it was not scheduled for today but was allowed to proceed. Is that correct?

Hi Jennifer,

Of course, I just looked up this ppt in RCC and can see the issue you describe below. Could you please verify the ppt is holding the tablet horizontally (button to the side)? I think this is what is meant when it asks for the screen to be in full mode.

Also, I can see the two separate entries for the ppt in RCC – 25426 and 25426.1
I assume the ppt is using the subject no 25426.1 when trying to launch the practice test under? I can see the date entered on the practice test page in RCC is 3 Nov 22. Can you please try to update this test to todays date of the 4th? We have had issues in the past with this.

Also on the computer, if the practice test shows an ‘unmark as complete’ button in the top right then please select this, as the reason the ppt is unable to launch the test could be because it has previously accidently launched on the computer. When this test is ‘open’ on the computer, it will not launch on the participant device. If you unmark as complete, the ppt should be able to launch the test on the tablet.

Kind regards,

Katie


I did yes! How can I reset the practice test for a subject in redcap cloud? She was not able to take the test last week, however, it recorded her demographics I suppose. Her forms say 0% completed. Also, it gives her an error message stating to make sure you are using her study tablet, has a good internet connection or her screen is open in full mode or something to the nature. She is on a study tablet, with good internet service, and states it's in full-screen mode.  Her number is 25426 for site 19700, she has two entries in red cap due to email access issues the first time she was added to the platform.

Hi Tami,

I hope this email finds you well! I’m just reaching out as I noticed that you have made a split CDR booking for participant 24279. 

If the split CDR sessions are required, then both the study partner and study participant portions must be conducted with the same rater.

Please either cancel both split CDR bookings and book a combined CDR session or amend one of the split CDR sessions so that they are conducted with the same rater."

	This email originated from outside of the organization. Do not click links or open attachments unless you recognize the sender and know the content is safe. 
Hello Malia,

Many thanks again for the support to address the issues escalated.  Did MDM ever provide information as to what was causing the reverting TV versioning issues;  the newly raised concern was that it was happening across multiple devices.   Are there any considerations or any investigation into whether there is a bulk of inventory likely also affected that we could potentially run across the same problem – to that end would we want to consider sending replacement devices?  

Also from a logistics perspective, these issues and the re-scheduling accommodations needed to complete the remaining assessments will continue to ‘eat’ into overall scheduling availability.  But the growing concern is, and more importantly, around participant burden - we unfortunately had a very upset Ppt with the last instance (which required a 3rd reschedule) and want to take every step to avoid this.  Again, if there is anything the CSCs and Cogstate support teams should be aware of so we’re not necessarily addressing this reactively but proactively – would welcome any input you have available.

Best,
Kathleen

Thanks Mabel,

The fix will push automatically once a tablet is online. So the CSC shouldn’t have to call in to Support to get the correction.

Hi Malia,

My understanding is the request was previously placed and corrected (as seen in the tickets), when the rater went to administer this morning, the version had again switched back. The session was cancelled as to not keep the participant waiting. 

@Mabel Valencia-Yang the CSC is Jennifer Rivera, I believe they were going to reach out to Clinical Ink again but I am unsure of that status. 

Best,
Delaney

Hi Malia,

I wanted to alert you to another case of Team Viewer reverting to the incorrect version. 

Participant 19000-26648, I am unsure of the IMEI number currently. The session was rescheduled from last week due to incorrect version. It was corrected but when the rater went to administer today, the incorrect version was back.

Please advise.

Hi Malia,

Escalating to your awareness and looping in @Mabel Valencia-Yang for any further assistance needed.  One of central raters this afternoon was in the process of preparing for a continued Psychometric session following the issue they encountered with the wrong versioning of TeamViewer.  As mentioned there were steps taken by the CSC (Emily Crofts) ahead of the sessions to ensure the app’s version was updated/uploaded appropriately but we received a call that it’s reverted back again (now 15.35.162 CL) on the Ppt’s device (Ppt 22027-10050).  I understand Emily is contact with CI Support now, so again wanted to raise to your attention – not sure what’s happening with this particular device.  Cogstate has advised our central rater to carry on with the appointment as best as able in the meanwhile.

@Mabel Valencia-Yang – I presume Emily has the IMEI no. to reference for CI Support; Cogstate does not have that info readily available.

Sorry for the ‘drive by’ – just wanted to relay if there’s any additional assistance available. 

Thanks,
Kathleen

Hi Kathleen,

Thanks for these details.

The team is looking into both topics:
1.	Support agents need to provide a case number and email resolution to users that call in
2.	TeamViewer version changes after a correction. The MDM team is investigating.

Hello Malia,

Sorry to say there was another event noted around TeamViewer and Ppt 22027-10050 at a V2 session.  In this instance the CSC (Emily Crofts) stated that they updated the TV app the day before with the patient and ensured version 15.22.136 CL was uploaded and confirmed with CI – as such they proceeded with the Psychometric session, but somehow the version reverted back to the incorrect one?  I understand the CSC was in touch with Gabriel Almanzar from CI Support but they did not get a ticket number on this case.  So, raising to your attention for awareness and assistance in helping to diagnose – also the concern is, as in this case, the tablet was able to update when there are expectations that they would be locked to specific versions? (Is that understanding correct?)

Thank you for your attention to this and any guidance you might be able to provide.

Best,
Kathleen

Hello Malia,

Many thanks for the outreach on this,…as I mentioned on your call earlier the resolution outlined below indeed addressed the issue cited on the TV app update needed for Ppt 20025 appointment from last week, but to clarify this was after the initial call made by the CSC to CIinical Ink.  By the CSC’s (Emily Cofts) account the feedback received by CI support upon her initial outreach was that there was ‘nothing further that could be done on their end’; resolution came from a 3-way call between the CSC, Cogstate and CI Support afterwards.   I think the other piece that I wanted to share was that the rep who handled both support calls in this case did not introduce themselves/provide a name or provide a ticket no. for referencing which seemed unusual from what has been customary.  

Hope this helps connect dots and either way many thanks for your help in aligning CI Support to TB3 study needs.  Please let us know if you have any further questions.

Best,
Kathleen

Hi Kathleen,

Thanks, as always, for sending the minutes in PDF format.

In regards to the TeamViewer support via Clinical ink Product Support agents, I wanted to gather more information to take back to the team.

On 20 Oct 22 I see ticket 0341342 that corrected the TV version for subject 20025.

Here is the agent’s resolution:
•	Remoted into the device by via Esper
•	Uninstalled/reinstalled to the new version of TV
•	Patient confirmed that it is set to the correct version
•	Issue resolved
Was something additional required of the CSC or rater in order to make this happen? What feedback did they receive from the support agent? 

I am happy to instruct the team that they need to send the resolution and ticket number to the CSC via email, but want to make sure I gather all the feedback before relaying it.

Any insight would be appreciate here.

Thank you!

Best,
Malia

Hello Malia,

Many thanks again for the support to address the issues escalated.  Did MDM ever provide information as to what was causing the reverting TV versioning issues;  the newly raised concern was that it was happening across multiple devices.   Are there any considerations or any investigation into whether there is a bulk of inventory likely also affected that we could potentially run across the same problem – to that end would we want to consider sending replacement devices?  

Also from a logistics perspective, these issues and the re-scheduling accommodations needed to complete the remaining assessments will continue to ‘eat’ into overall scheduling availability.  But the growing concern is, and more importantly, around participant burden - we unfortunately had a very upset Ppt with the last instance (which required a 3rd reschedule) and want to take every step to avoid this.  Again, if there is anything the CSCs and Cogstate support teams should be aware of so we’re not necessarily addressing this reactively but proactively – would welcome any input you have available.

Best,
Kathleen

Thanks Mabel,

The fix will push automatically once a tablet is online. So the CSC shouldn’t have to call in to Support to get the correction.

Hi Malia,

My understanding is the request was previously placed and corrected (as seen in the tickets), when the rater went to administer this morning, the version had again switched back. The session was cancelled as to not keep the participant waiting. 

@Mabel Valencia-Yang the CSC is Jennifer Rivera, I believe they were going to reach out to Clinical Ink again but I am unsure of that status. 

Best,
Delaney

Hi Malia,

I wanted to alert you to another case of Team Viewer reverting to the incorrect version. 

Participant 19000-26648, I am unsure of the IMEI number currently. The session was rescheduled from last week due to incorrect version. It was corrected but when the rater went to administer today, the incorrect version was back.

Please advise.

Hi Malia,

Escalating to your awareness and looping in @Mabel Valencia-Yang for any further assistance needed.  One of central raters this afternoon was in the process of preparing for a continued Psychometric session following the issue they encountered with the wrong versioning of TeamViewer.  As mentioned there were steps taken by the CSC (Emily Crofts) ahead of the sessions to ensure the app’s version was updated/uploaded appropriately but we received a call that it’s reverted back again (now 15.35.162 CL) on the Ppt’s device (Ppt 22027-10050).  I understand Emily is contact with CI Support now, so again wanted to raise to your attention – not sure what’s happening with this particular device.  Cogstate has advised our central rater to carry on with the appointment as best as able in the meanwhile.

@Mabel Valencia-Yang – I presume Emily has the IMEI no. to reference for CI Support; Cogstate does not have that info readily available.

Sorry for the ‘drive by’ – just wanted to relay if there’s any additional assistance available. 

Thanks,
Kathleen

Hi Kathleen,

Thanks for these details.

The team is looking into both topics:
1.	Support agents need to provide a case number and email resolution to users that call in
2.	TeamViewer version changes after a correction. The MDM team is investigating.

Hello Malia,

Sorry to say there was another event noted around TeamViewer and Ppt 22027-10050 at a V2 session.  In this instance the CSC (Emily Crofts) stated that they updated the TV app the day before with the patient and ensured version 15.22.136 CL was uploaded and confirmed with CI – as such they proceeded with the Psychometric session, but somehow the version reverted back to the incorrect one?  I understand the CSC was in touch with Gabriel Almanzar from CI Support but they did not get a ticket number on this case.  So, raising to your attention for awareness and assistance in helping to diagnose – also the concern is, as in this case, the tablet was able to update when there are expectations that they would be locked to specific versions? (Is that understanding correct?)

Thank you for your attention to this and any guidance you might be able to provide.

Best,
Kathleen

Hello Malia,

Many thanks for the outreach on this,…as I mentioned on your call earlier the resolution outlined below indeed addressed the issue cited on the TV app update needed for Ppt 20025 appointment from last week, but to clarify this was after the initial call made by the CSC to CIinical Ink.  By the CSC’s (Emily Cofts) account the feedback received by CI support upon her initial outreach was that there was ‘nothing further that could be done on their end’; resolution came from a 3-way call between the CSC, Cogstate and CI Support afterwards.   I think the other piece that I wanted to share was that the rep who handled both support calls in this case did not introduce themselves/provide a name or provide a ticket no. for referencing which seemed unusual from what has been customary.  

Hope this helps connect dots and either way many thanks for your help in aligning CI Support to TB3 study needs.  Please let us know if you have any further questions.

Best,
Kathleen

Hi Kathleen,

Thanks, as always, for sending the minutes in PDF format.

In regards to the TeamViewer support via Clinical ink Product Support agents, I wanted to gather more information to take back to the team.

On 20 Oct 22 I see ticket 0341342 that corrected the TV version for subject 20025.

Here is the agent’s resolution:
•	Remoted into the device by via Esper
•	Uninstalled/reinstalled to the new version of TV
•	Patient confirmed that it is set to the correct version
•	Issue resolved
Was something additional required of the CSC or rater in order to make this happen? What feedback did they receive from the support agent? 

I am happy to instruct the team that they need to send the resolution and ticket number to the CSC via email, but want to make sure I gather all the feedback before relaying it.

Any insight would be appreciate here.

Thank you!

Best,
Malia

Hello Malia,

Many thanks again for the support to address the issues escalated.  Did MDM ever provide information as to what was causing the reverting TV versioning issues;  the newly raised concern was that it was happening across multiple devices.   Are there any considerations or any investigation into whether there is a bulk of inventory likely also affected that we could potentially run across the same problem – to that end would we want to consider sending replacement devices?  

Also from a logistics perspective, these issues and the re-scheduling accommodations needed to complete the remaining assessments will continue to ‘eat’ into overall scheduling availability.  But the growing concern is, and more importantly, around participant burden - we unfortunately had a very upset Ppt with the last instance (which required a 3rd reschedule) and want to take every step to avoid this.  Again, if there is anything the CSCs and Cogstate support teams should be aware of so we’re not necessarily addressing this reactively but proactively – would welcome any input you have available.

Best,
Kathleen

Thanks Mabel,

The fix will push automatically once a tablet is online. So the CSC shouldn’t have to call in to Support to get the correction.

Hi Malia,

My understanding is the request was previously placed and corrected (as seen in the tickets), when the rater went to administer this morning, the version had again switched back. The session was cancelled as to not keep the participant waiting. 

@Mabel Valencia-Yang the CSC is Jennifer Rivera, I believe they were going to reach out to Clinical Ink again but I am unsure of that status. 

Best,
Delaney

Hi Malia,

I wanted to alert you to another case of Team Viewer reverting to the incorrect version. 

Participant 19000-26648, I am unsure of the IMEI number currently. The session was rescheduled from last week due to incorrect version. It was corrected but when the rater went to administer today, the incorrect version was back.

Please advise.

Hi Malia,

Escalating to your awareness and looping in @Mabel Valencia-Yang for any further assistance needed.  One of central raters this afternoon was in the process of preparing for a continued Psychometric session following the issue they encountered with the wrong versioning of TeamViewer.  As mentioned there were steps taken by the CSC (Emily Crofts) ahead of the sessions to ensure the app’s version was updated/uploaded appropriately but we received a call that it’s reverted back again (now 15.35.162 CL) on the Ppt’s device (Ppt 22027-10050).  I understand Emily is contact with CI Support now, so again wanted to raise to your attention – not sure what’s happening with this particular device.  Cogstate has advised our central rater to carry on with the appointment as best as able in the meanwhile.

@Mabel Valencia-Yang – I presume Emily has the IMEI no. to reference for CI Support; Cogstate does not have that info readily available.

Sorry for the ‘drive by’ – just wanted to relay if there’s any additional assistance available. 

Thanks,
Kathleen

Hi Kathleen,

Thanks for these details.

The team is looking into both topics:
1.	Support agents need to provide a case number and email resolution to users that call in
2.	TeamViewer version changes after a correction. The MDM team is investigating.

Hello Malia,

Sorry to say there was another event noted around TeamViewer and Ppt 22027-10050 at a V2 session.  In this instance the CSC (Emily Crofts) stated that they updated the TV app the day before with the patient and ensured version 15.22.136 CL was uploaded and confirmed with CI – as such they proceeded with the Psychometric session, but somehow the version reverted back to the incorrect one?  I understand the CSC was in touch with Gabriel Almanzar from CI Support but they did not get a ticket number on this case.  So, raising to your attention for awareness and assistance in helping to diagnose – also the concern is, as in this case, the tablet was able to update when there are expectations that they would be locked to specific versions? (Is that understanding correct?)

Thank you for your attention to this and any guidance you might be able to provide.

Best,
Kathleen

Hello Malia,

Many thanks for the outreach on this,…as I mentioned on your call earlier the resolution outlined below indeed addressed the issue cited on the TV app update needed for Ppt 20025 appointment from last week, but to clarify this was after the initial call made by the CSC to CIinical Ink.  By the CSC’s (Emily Cofts) account the feedback received by CI support upon her initial outreach was that there was ‘nothing further that could be done on their end’; resolution came from a 3-way call between the CSC, Cogstate and CI Support afterwards.   I think the other piece that I wanted to share was that the rep who handled both support calls in this case did not introduce themselves/provide a name or provide a ticket no. for referencing which seemed unusual from what has been customary.  

Hope this helps connect dots and either way many thanks for your help in aligning CI Support to TB3 study needs.  Please let us know if you have any further questions.

Best,
Kathleen

Hi Kathleen,

Thanks, as always, for sending the minutes in PDF format.

In regards to the TeamViewer support via Clinical ink Product Support agents, I wanted to gather more information to take back to the team.

On 20 Oct 22 I see ticket 0341342 that corrected the TV version for subject 20025.

Here is the agent’s resolution:
•	Remoted into the device by via Esper
•	Uninstalled/reinstalled to the new version of TV
•	Patient confirmed that it is set to the correct version
•	Issue resolved
Was something additional required of the CSC or rater in order to make this happen? What feedback did they receive from the support agent? 

I am happy to instruct the team that they need to send the resolution and ticket number to the CSC via email, but want to make sure I gather all the feedback before relaying it.

Any insight would be appreciate here.

Thank you!

Best,
Malia

Hi George,
 
Due to the nature of time sensitivity as well as Cogstate not be privy to PHI/PII, the below actions were taken for another similar case (pending confirmation the problem has been resolved):
 
Please reach out to RedCapCloud directly, specifically Ahmad Noori, who will be able to see if the username for the participant has been previously changed or modified. Contact: anoori@redcapcloud.com 
 
Ahmad will need additional information (email, phone, etc.) regarding the participant account to look up the registered accounts, please leave Cogstate staff off this communication as we are not disclosed to see these materials. 
 
Thank you for your patience and persistence in this issue.

Subject: Re: Subject 13190 Site 14650 Assistance with Participant Account
 
Hello,
 
After working with the participant, we reached the part where we could reset their password with the phone number. However, once we got to the part to enter the phone number to reset the password, the system would say ""Phone number is not valid"". I double checked to make sure this was correct in the system and it is. If we can't have a way for the participant to login then we cannot complete the cognitive test for the trial. Any suggestions or assistance will be appreciated.
 
Warm Regards,

Hi Mabel,

Thank you for the clarification. Could you verify in RCC of a phone number was also entered for this participant along with the email address? If a phone number was used and the email is entered incorrectly, the likely cause is the participant activated their account with a phone number as their username. They can reset their password for the phone number username following the same steps as the email, with the except of selecting “login with phone” instead of email.

If the username entered was this incorrect, it will remain incorrect as once the participant activities their account with the details entered (email and phone) these details are not changeable within the EDC.

Many thanks,

Katie

Hi Delaney, 

For clarification, the participant’s email address was entered incorrectly. They are not able to reset their password as their correct email address does not register with myRCC and the participant does not have access to the incorrect email address. Can you assist on correcting the email address or opening the form to allow the CSC to correct on our end? 

Kindly, 
Mabel

Can you please ensure this is completed prior to the 2:15 EST visit today? Once the form is complete, there is a delay for the V2 forms to download and we would like to avoid making the participant wait.

Hi Shanice,

Thank you for reaching out. Ashley informed me the participant is not able to reset their password due to their ability to access their email account. 

Unfortunately, we cannot update the email once data has been received for the participant. Can you confirm the participant is unable to access their email or was unable to during the assessment? 

Thank you in advance.

Best,
Delaney

Thank you for reaching out. You will need to generate the self-administered portions of V9 from the CSC role within RCC. You can do this by navigating to the subject number in RCC and then selecting “Add Event” in the top right corner. You will see the below update.

 

The rater only administered the V9 rater administered tests, not the self-administered. 

Please let me know if I can provide any additional information or assistance.

Delaney & Team,

   I just wanted to double check that Subject 10637's V9 Cogstate Testing Part 2 is completed?  When I was going to have them start it today this is what we seen on their tablet it looks like it was completed on 17OCT2022.  I also logged into my RCC and it looks like the same as another patient that I completed V9 assessments with last week.  Just want some clarification to make sure this task has been completed otherwise I will need to reschedule and somehow trigger this task since I though that was the CSCs job however it looks like the Rater may have completed this if everything is completed.

 
Thank you,

Hi Claudia,
 
I hope this email finds you well. Reaching out as it raised to me the forms for V9 were not available for our central rater to begin on eCOA last night and the visit was conducted on paper. 
 
Please load the appropriate V9 into Clinical Ink at your earliest convenience for our rater to transcribe the visit. Our central raters do not have the permissions to add visits to the participant chart, therefore we request you add these visits prior to the CDR appointment.
 
Please let me know if you have any questions.
 
Best,
Delaney

Hi Hallie,

Thank you for alerting us. I looked at the participants chart and I do not currently see any data that has been received for the Practice.

Did the participant receive this message after the battery closed or after re-logging in?
 
Please ensure the participant is connected to a stable WiFi connection and the orientation of tablet remains the same during the test to avoid closure. 

If the participant did not receive the above error message, no data was received from the session and a retake will be required.

Best,
Delaney

Good afternoon – 

AACM – Site 14450

I have participant 28803 working through the V2 Practice Assessment. He was almost to the end, but it kicked him out to the home screen of the Cogstate app. It was still making chime noises as if he were in the assessment. We opened up the practice assessment again and it’s making him start over. Can you look on your end to see if there is an issue?

Hi George, 
 
Apologies, I’m not following if the participant has been able to login. The last email from you indicates the participant was able to access their account. I just went into the participant profile in RCC and see the practice test was launched but closed immediately after launch.
 
I’m happy to give you a call if that would assist better. Please let me know a time that works for you.

Hello Delaney,
 
I just got off the phone with subject 22582 from Site 14650 and the subject states their account requires an invite. We cannot send the invite since the system only allows for one extra invite. I have had the subject reset their password and do all the other things you have suggested. Is there any way for us to close the account associated with their e-mail and just make another account so we can proceed? This issue has been ongoing for some time and it's difficult to schedule with the participant. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Hello,

I have a subject on the line who is attempting the Cognitive Testing Practice Run. When the subject selected “Begin Assessment” to get started, there was an error. I instructed him to try again and it would not work. We exited out and came back into the Cogstate app and now it says the practice was “completed” and won’t allow him to start the assessment.

Please advise on next steps.

An update! Our system vendor will need the participant details to further their investigation. Since Cogstate is blinded to PHI/PII disclosed in the system, can you please reach out to Ahmad at RCC directly to provide the details the participant has entered into the system? anoori@redcapcloud.com
 
Please keep Cogstate off this communication as RCC will need information directly from you that pertains to the participant and what is currently held in the system. 
 
If I hear anything on my end, I will follow up with you as well.

It's a red box that appears at the top of the tablet when the participant tries to start the practice exam. It's along the lines of saying to make sure it is the correct study tablet assigned for the exam and to make sure the tablet has a high enough charge or plugged in.

Hi George,
 
Please ensure the tablet is in the correct orientation (horizontal or landscape mode). The power button should be located on the side of the tablet when the participant launches the test, otherwise the test will not fit on the screen and a red error message will populate. 
 
Best,
Delaney

Hey Delaney!

This subject is having an error pop up saying that the device is not correct for the exam. Even though he is on the assigned Cogstate tablet. I confirmed with the participant that they are on wifi and good internet as well as they are on the correct tablet as well. Any help with this issue would be appreciated.

Thanks!

It looks from your screenshot you’re using a password manager, this could be affecting the password field after the account has been locked. I would continue with the opening a new browser window to login back in.

Subject: Re: ""Unlock"" login issue on website

Hi Delaney,

Thanks! The issue myself and Darcie are having is we cannot re-enter our password at this screen. The password field is locked, as is the username field, so we cannot re-enter any information to Unlock. Is this by design as you mentioned?

I wanted to confirm because in my previous email I noted that there was one instance where I was able to actually re enter my password but otherwise we cannot unlock and have to start a new session in a different browser. If this is expected behavior that’s fine, but Mabel and other CSCs indicated they have not run into this issue.

Thank you and have a good weekend!

Hi Erin,
 
The system is an EDC, therefore has an automatic log out after extended periods of time within activity. 
 
To login back in, you will need to re-enter your password, and/or if prolonged inactivity, will need to re-sign in within a new window. 
 
This is a security measure to ensure data is secure. Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Subject: ""Unlock"" login issue on website
 
Hi there,
 
Myself and my coworker Darcie keep on running into this screen after being logged into Cogstate RCC for a period of time:
 
 
 
When this occurs, all of the fields are completely locked (ie I can’t edit my email or password) and clicking on “Unlock” does nothing. There was an instance a few weeks ago where I was able to actually re-enter the password to Unlock, but otherwise I have to start a new session in a different browser to get back in again.
 
Can you please advise if this is a known issue and if there is any other way to bypass this? I am using Chrome browse version 106.0.5249.103 and Darcie told me she uses Chrome as well.
 
Thanks!
Best,

Description of Issue:
Yes, while the participant was undergoing the test, there was two errors that occurred. 

One was, one of the buttons were not functioning during the test, so we had to restart. 

The other issue, was the program freezing multiple times and made us restart the testing again. In this particular timepoint, the program froze and then unfroze after a short period, during that time, some cards may have passed and therefore, when the pt was undergoing if you have seen these cards before test, he was saying no, but the correct answer was yes. This could be due to cards flipping when the program was frozen.

Just a bit of information as to why I reported technical difficulties. I hope this clears it up.

Can you confirm the subject is using the same email address as entered into the system originally for the password reset? The email address in RCC itself will be linked to the registration and if another email is being used to create a new account it will not link to the study.

You can resend the invitation email by navigating to the subject line in RCC. On the far-right side of the screen, the green check mark should be selected. On this page you will see the email address entered for the participant and be able to re-send the invite.

Hello,
 
My name is Hinali Zaveri and I am the CSC for site 18100 for AACM clinical trial. I was trying to book psychometric rating combined session for my study participant and partner. However; I do not see appt for 6PM EST for next week any day. Unfortunately, my study participant partner cannot make it any day before 6PM for the assessment because of his work schedule. I wanted to see if I can have them scheduled next week from Tues-Thursday for anytime after 6PM EST appt with the rater. I already have CDR combined booked for 6:45PM for Monday so anyday beside Monday and Friday will be good to have Psychometric assessment done after 6PM EST
 
Pls let me know so I can inform the subject

Dear Robert 

I am kindly following up on this. Site was advised initially advised by the
agent as below;
-- > Cogstate informed that the issue that you are having is due to the cables
are not connected since the beginning into the device. They advise to connect
the cables even before you turn on the device. Please try this and let us know
if the problems still persist .

SC replied;
--> I explained for several Times that plugging in the cables before starting
the device is not possible because than I am not able to enter data with text
field like year of birth or something else. I am also not able to navigate
trough the system.
It is not possible to plug in cable an navigate.

Above is the last feedback we got from the site. Patient ID is 30126.

I have followed up with site to provide more information as you requested in
your email on 02/09/2022 21:32

Site: W01-DE10004 - Cogstate Battery - Error Launching Battery

 

Message:

 



Hello Andrea Hernandez,

 

Thank you for contacting Cogstate for additional support.

 

For Cogstate to best support you and the site, please provide as much detail as
possible when escalating support tickets.

 * What is the Subject ID and Visit timepoint?
   
   
 * Can you confirm that the site followed proper guidance when connecting the
   testing equipment?
   * The ‘No’ External Response Button plugged into port 1 of the White Response
     Box.
   * The ‘Yes’ External Response Button plugged into port 2 of the White
     Response Box.
   * The White Response Box plugged into the testing device via USB.

 

Tip: You can have the sites check to see if the buttons are responding before
they even sign in to the CeP.

After connecting the equipment, have them click inside the text field where they
type their username. Then, have them press each External Response Button. If
done correctly, they should see letters appear in the text field after each
press.



 * Can you elaborate on what exactly happens during these crashes?
   * Do any error messages appear?
   * Does the testing device power off?
   * Does the user get logged out of their CeP account?
   * Do they always get sent to the same screen with each “crash”?
   * Can the site provide any pictures, videos, or screenshots of this event?
     
     

 * Do you know if the user is accidentally marking the ""1. Begin Cogstate
   Battery"" form as complete before clicking the [Begin Assessment] button?

 * Sometimes staff will enter their subject's DOB and accidentally click the
   ""Save and Exit"" button in the upper right corner instead of ""Begin
   Assessment."" Clicking [Save and Exit] instead of [Begin Assessment] will mark
   the ""1. Begin Cogstate Battery"" form as complete, which prohibits the
   Cogstate Battery from launching. Fortunately, if they accidentally do this,
   have them open the ""1. Begin Cogstate Battery"" form and click the [Unmark as
   Complete] button where [Save and Exit] was in the upper right corner.

 

 * Last, would you please describe what troubleshooting steps were attempted
   with the site?

 

Best regards,

Robert Bartholomew

I would like to inform we have this site with an issue after they have started
the assesment, they have entered the date of birth of the patient and reach the
point to connect the cables to the tablet. As soon as the cables are connected
the system crash and get her back to the first screen where the study
coordinator has to log in. 

We try several times and always reach the same point. Please advise what needs
to be done as they have several patients comming and they are missing this
assesment

Hi Mabel,
 
Thanks for reaching out. Unfortunately we have no availability for raters at weekends, so we are unable to accommodate this. May I suggest if the ppt has availability later today, we could book in the psychometric appt for later on to ensure that this ppt stays within the protocol window? Please let me know if this is an option and times that the ppt would be available if possible? The CSC will be unable to book this on Bookings as it is less than 12 hours to the appointment but we could create this manually as long as we had the following information from the CSC:
 
CSC name and email
Time of appointment (including time zone)
Zoom link and passcode
Site and ppt number
Visit number
 
Moving forward, we advise CSCs to check in advance that ppts will be available for both appointments within the protocol window, and book both in together if possible. We’ve seen an uptick in CSCs doing this and booking CDR and psychometric appointments at the same time, for example a CDR one day and the psychometric the next. 
 
Please let me know!
 
Kind regards,
 
Katie

Message:



Hi there,

 

The site 103 indicated in Cogstate Battery notes that they didn’t receive the
Piko Buttons for the study. The buttons are all shipped from Cogstate to Clario
study team, and are supposed to be shipped to the participating sites from
Clario. Could you investigate below and reach out to the site on this?

The site 103 indicated in Cogstate Battery notes that they didn’t receive the
Piko Buttons for the study. The buttons are all shipped from Cogstate to Clario
study team, and are supposed to be shipped to the participating sites from
Clario. Could you investigate below and reach out to the site on this?

I have been trying to complete the C3 Cogstate Training in order to gain access.
When I try to administer a practice test through the provided tablet, there is a
notification that pops up that states that test is unable to load. I have
created multiple test subjects, but each have amounted to the same thing.
I tried to do the same C3 training for a different study I am working with, and
I was able to gain access to the practice test and complete my training. Please
advise. I need c3 access ASAP as the current SC who is certified is leaving
today. Consent

Hi LaVonda,
 
Thanks for reaching out. In regard to generating your practice test in RCC, I refer you back to the welcome email containing instructions on next steps:

Once you have completed the training curriculum, you will need to log in to Cogstate eSource Platform myRCC version on the study device and complete a Test Supervisor Applied Training Test to attain certification. 
 
How to create a mock participant for training within the Cogstate eSource Platform
 
1.	Log into RCC on your personal laptop https://cogstate.login.redcapcloud.com/
2.	Click the Subjects tab to the left of the screen
3.	Click Add a Subject (top right corner) 
4.	Select Training Site – TRAILBLAZER-ALZ3 Training Site from the drop down
5.	Subject Number = Type “TestXX”  in the field (Note: Instead of XX type your first and last initial, example: Jane Doe = TestJD)
6.	Study Group = “Practice”
7.	Select any option for the following three fields:
a.	Year of Birth 
b.	Sex
c.	Language
8.	Add your own centralclinicalservices.com email to the myREDCapCloud Data field (to be sent a link for the Applied Training Test on the study tablet device)
a.	Select “The participant has already given consent for or initiated electronic communications” (top option). Leave the other option unchecked.
b.	DO NOT enter a phone number
9.	Click Save and Exit (top right corner)
10.	(You will be taken back to the Subjects tab)
11.	Your new subject TestXX will be at the top of the list
12.	Click on the three blue lines to the far right of the screen for your TestXX subject
13.	Again, select the top option to Select “The participant has already given consent for or initiated electronic communications”
14.	Check the email which should be auto filled. It should all be in lower case.
15.	Again, DO NOT input a phone number
16.	Select ‘Invite patient’.
16.1 You can check an invite has been sent as the three blue lines should be replaced by a green tick on the home screen.
 
Complete the following steps on your study tablet:
 
Note - Please check you have good Wi-Fi and the tablet is turned horizontal (home button on the side) the entire duration of the test.
17.	Login to myRCC on the study tablet with the credentials you created after inviting yourself as a practice participant
18.	Open the Practice visit form, by clicking anywhere on the line.
19.	Click Begin Cogstate Self-Administered Cognitive Tests (Practice Run)
20.	Begin the battery and complete all sections with equal effort to pass.

Subject: AACM Cogstate Issue - Subject 16437 - Site 13350

 

Hi Chelsea,

 

Here’s a recap from our call we had yesterday. Subject 16437 needs to complete
her Cogstate Practice Run, we had this appointment scheduled a week ago and
unfortunately, we were not able to complete it. I registered her into the
Cogstate system and added the practice forms, but they were not populating on
her study provided tablet. The participant tried logging in to Cogstate with her
personal laptop and when she logged in through her laptop the forms were showing
but she could not complete the forms through her personal laptop because the
Cogstate system is set up to where the tests can only be completed on the study
provided tablet. I tried to troubleshoot as much as possible, but my attempts
were unsuccessful.

 

I emailed Cogstate support that same night and they emailed me the next morning
but were no help at all. They sent me over to my Study Team as they mentioned
they could not help with my issue.

 

Attached is a screenshot of the email they sent.

 

 

Kind Regards,

Thank you for reaching out. Please see the below instructions if your visit “Practice” is not generating for your test participant.

If your visit schedule is not showing for a subject, it is most likely because the Event Schedule was not generated when the subject was created. To rectify:
•	Click on the subject ID and then select Edit Events in top-right corner. 








•	Then click Generate Schedule.




•	Select today’s date and press Save and Exit.

If no visits were showing for a subject, you can avoid this happening again by pressing Next after you have entered the subject’s demographics to allow the visit schedule to generate, instead of Save and Exit. 

If there is not a visit to select from you drop down in the generate schedule, this could be because the incorrect study group was selected in the demographics portion of subject set-up. Please verify the study group is set to “Practice” for your practice subject.

Please reach out with any questions.

Best,
Delaney

If there is not a visit to select from you drop down in the generate schedule, this could be because the incorrect study group was selected in the demographics portion of subject set-up. Please verify the study group is set to “Practice” for your practice subject.
 
Please reach out with any questions.

Hi Jennifer,
 
Thank you for reaching out. Please see the below instructions if your visit “Practice” is not generating for your test participant.
 
 If your visit schedule is not showing for a subject, it is most likely because the Event Schedule was not generated when the subject was created. To rectify:
•	Click on the subject ID and then select Edit Events in top-right corner. 








•	Then click Generate Schedule.
 



•	Select today’s date and press Save and Exit.
 
If no visits were showing for a subject, you can avoid this happening again by pressing Next after you have entered the subject’s demographics to allow the visit schedule to generate, instead of Save and Exit. 
 
If there is not a visit to select from you drop down in the generate schedule, this could be because the incorrect study group was selected in the demographics portion of subject set-up. Please verify the study group is set to “Practice” for your practice subject.
 
Please reach out with any questions.
 
Best,
Delaney

Hi Angel,
 
Thank you for reaching out. We currently have a rater out of office which has limited some of our availability.
 
We have availability next week on the 17th or 18th in the morning or afternoon for the participant’s CDR appointment. Please let me know if either of these dates work for the participant and yourself. 
 
While we are discussing, we have availability for the psychometric session on Monday August 22nd after 10am EST. 
 
Please let me know which of these options works best.

If the participant attempted to launch the battery with the tablet in vertical orientation, this would result in the battery closing out after launch and showing “complete”. The completion status indicates the participant launched the assessment.

To unmark as complete, please login to the online RCC portal and select your participants subject number.

Once selected you will navigate to the events page and select the ‘practice’ assessment. 

Select the “Begin Cogstate Self-Administer Cognitive Tests (Practice Run)”
 

Upon selection, you will see “Unmark as Complete” in the top right corner.

Once selected, the participant will be able to re-launch the practice test. 

Please reach out if you have any questions.

The Below listed site is having problems getting the Battery to load. I have

loads a page with no information. The problem could be an IT lock out on their
end. Just wanted to reach out to be sure there is no problems on your side you
can find.

Thank you for your time.

She had previously made a ticket at https://www.cogstate.com/cogstate-support-request/ but hasn't yet received a response regarding a password-reset. As the deadline for archive report downloading from Datapoint is nearly up, could we ask for your assistance with this issue? A simple password-reset would be enough for dr. Jakuš to access the site, if a link or temporary password could be sent to her email address.

Here is the additional information from the ticket, and I've also put the CRA Marija Radi?ek in cc of this email, if you need additional information.

Gemelli Hospital) for protocol 42847922MDD1016: site staff (Dr. Leone and Dr.
Moriconi) received the Cogstate Laptop and approached the Cogstate Practice Test
but they both reported the following issue: in the part of the test in which
rater has to chase a target it was impossible to click on the boxes (as if
another cursor was needed or the key was wrong). As per instruction, they have
continued with the practice test, but the final screen states that they have to
repeat the test.
Could you please reach out site staff and help them to solve this issue?

CSC cannot log into RCC due to expired credentials,TrailBlazer3/AACM,Completed,Katie Shortland;Delaney Taylor;Member,06/17/2022,,06/27/2022,Delaney Taylor,I5T-MC-AACM,Training Test,"CSC Maria Magdalena Alvarado-Garcia emailed to say 'I am trying to complete the last portion of the training on Cogstate Instructor; however, I am unable to access the ""Lilly Rater Academy: Applied Training Test Session (completed in RCC)"", a message appears that I must use the study device to complete my Cogstate training. 


When I go to the device to complete the Training Test Session(completed in RCC), it sends a message that my credentials have expired.  I have also, attached the email that Cogstate sent me with my username and to create a password.  Which I did the steps indicated but still not able to logon to the device.  My credentials have not expired and need your assistance with the issue'

It looks in the first screenshot attached that she is in Instructor rather than RCC. The second screenshot where it states credentials expired appears to be in RCC.

Maria's credentials has expired because the invite to RCC (when she was invited to do training) was sent on 8th June and not actioned for over a week. We went into RCC as an admin and resent the invite. 

Maria then called on 20 June saying she could not log into RCC still. When we asked for an email with screenshots, she had not entered the correct email (centralclinical.com, omitting 'services' at the end of the email).

She then said she couldn't save the practice subject she created TestMMAG and I told her to make sure the study group was 'practice' not 'mock participant' she selected as shown in the screenshot."

However, ppt clicked on the link and it went to page unfound. On RCC our side it said ppt has not actioned the invite.

Katie checked no phone numbers input and email all in lower case. Asked if ppt was using an iphone, and she was. So suggested asking ppt to log in on laptop using chrome extension to open the link on the invite. Katie sent another invite to ppt on RCC from admin account to see if ppt was able to use this instead.

Bailey called back to say ppt received that invite too using her laptop in chrome but same error message appeared. We checked the ppt had not registered herself in RCC before Bailey sent the invite or used her study tablet at all prior to the invite, confirmed she hadn't.

Final suggestion was to ask ppt to use the 'Forgot password' function on tablet to see if that would gain access to RCC. Bailey is going to feedback with email and provide screenshots of error message. May need to escalate to Chris B.

ppt has not yet completed practice test. Participant was able to complete practice DT"

I'm writing to you as the Site Manager for the Italian site IT-10002: site staff
received the Cogstate Laptop and approached the Cogstate Practice Test but they
faced the following issue: the 2 response buttons (2 different colors) have been
set up as per guideline and they initially worked but after starting the
Practice Test both buttons sopped to work; site staff referred that the Practice
Test was still completed using the keyboard except for the "" labyrinth test""
which cannot be performed with the keyboard and then was skipped.
Could you please support site staff to resolve this issue?
Please let me know what information you need in order to contact/support them
and I will provide it to you.
Many thanks in advance.

I tried to call the Cogstate phone number but could not get a hold of anyone at Cogstate to help walk me through this. We are going to have to skip this testing session and try to pick it up at their next visit because I don't know what else to do at the moment.

Dear Robert,

Thank you for your response. The site and I did attempt to enter the study code
""BronzeSword"" into the Browser Registration app, but the code was not accepted
as valid. I did attempt to ensure that the customer was entering ""BronzeSword""
exactly as it is written.

Please find below the steps listed in our KB article about this issue:

Step 1: Verify that the tablet indeed has a internet connection 

Step 2: Go to the Airwatch Secure Launcher screen

Step 3: Open the app ""Browser Registration"" (if it is not there check in
Airwatch and push an update)

Step 4: You will see a screen where you need to enter a study code name. Enter
the appropriate study code name and click on Submit.
(For the Janssen_80202135SJS2001 study you need to enter BronzeSword)

Step 5: On the next screen verify that the internal name shows in the section
called “List of studies configured for the device”.

Step 6: Close the window and open the eCOA App again and try to start the
Cogstate Battery again. It should be able to start now.

Dear Cogstate Team,

This eMail has been sent to you according to the below mentioned issue.

I need some clarification. The Study Coordinator is using the 

Tablet K10 and cannot see the Cogstate app on her device. I had her go into
Airwatch and click on Browser Registration but nothing happened.
I checked in Airwatch and the software is up to date and its showing that the
Cogstate web is listed as one of the apps.
Is the icon suppose to show on the home screen , or only when they log in and do
the visit.
SC doesnt know where she needs to enter her code. She has finished all of her
ERT Learning and has the certificate.
Please advise

I looked into her training test and it appears the training test was not passed, I instructed the CSC to retake the training test. The CSC retook the training test but failed the ""One Back Performance"" section, I let the CSC know they could complete only the One Back section again and we would review the results once received. If passed, they could become certified. CSC did not pass last attempt, this case has been escalated to science. CSC was requested to retake the test, I reached out to the CSC today 16May22 because they have not retaken the test and scheduled a V2 on Bookings. DT NTF has been added to Box for the early certification error. CSC passed practice test, certified 16may22"

Please provide me with the credentials to access Cogstate.' I looked in instructor and saw she had completed the e learning modules but not the practice test. I advised her to log into RCC using the link in the first email and create a mock subject, listing it as a ‘practice’. Then use your own email for the subject, invite yourself to complete this test. Full details for the process will be found in the CSC manual included in your Cogstate welcome email.

Nancy then called the helpline as she received an error message at the end of her completed test stating 'The test cannot be completed in the future'. We logged into RCC back office and could see she had failed the same one back portion of the test as the first attempt, so I stayed on the phone while she launched the test on the tablet for the third time. I told her to ensure that she had good wifi connection and to ensure the date when she relaunched the test was showing todays date and correct time, rather than just the date she created the subject (12th May)"

Katie and Delaney called LaShonda back, and explained that we could see the ppt subject created in RCC but no data was saved for the test, so we suspect a WIFI issue. In terms of the battery not being able to re-launch, we advised LaShonda to make sure that the ppt launched the test in horizontal mode and kept it that way throughout the test. As no data was saved from this first test, the ppt will need to complete the practice assessment again."

Dear Robert,

Thank you for your response. The site and I did attempt to enter the study code
""BronzeSword"" into the Browser Registration app, but the code was not accepted
as valid. I did attempt to ensure that the customer was entering ""BronzeSword""
exactly as it is written.

Please find below the steps listed in our KB article about this issue:

Step 1: Verify that the tablet indeed has a internet connection 

Step 2: Go to the Airwatch Secure Launcher screen

Step 3: Open the app ""Browser Registration"" (if it is not there check in
Airwatch and push an update)

Step 4: You will see a screen where you need to enter a study code name. Enter
the appropriate study code name and click on Submit.
(For the Janssen_80202135SJS2001 study you need to enter BronzeSword)

Step 5: On the next screen verify that the internal name shows in the section
called “List of studies configured for the device”.

Step 6: Close the window and open the eCOA App again and try to start the
Cogstate Battery again. It should be able to start now.

Message:

 



Hello Keith,

 

Thank you for providing Cogstate with this update.

It sounds like the primary issue is that the device is not registered for this
study.

 

Can you confirm whether you were able to walk the site through registering their
K10 for this study (i.e., entering ""BronzeSword"" into the device's Browser
Registration app)?

If not, please let me know how far they got and where they got stuck.

 

Cogstate also provided steps for Clario's Project Management team to incorporate
into a knowledgebase article. Would you please share a copy so that I can
confirm the correct steps were available?

 

Please let me know if there are any questions.

 

Best regards,

Robert Bartholomew

Could you help me with this issue? We would like to get certification for :

completed, but we do not have the certificate.
Is there any chance to receive that certificates from you or to successfully
reset SI password for cogstate instructor website? I would be grateful if you

They had finished the ISLT in the Psychometric session and the ppt was trying to log into my RCC for the next section, but couldn't remember their password. By the time Hallie called the helpline there was 1 password attempt left before they were locked out. I asked her to ensure that the ppt was using all lower case letters in the username email as verified on RCC as their login. She said that when they went to change their password, they could not see the 'password changed' notification that should have come up. Potential user error perhaps in not successfully completing the password reset?

After being put on hold, she let me know that the ppt was now unfortunately locked out of my RCC. As it had been 50 minutes since the ISLT portion was finished, the decision was made to reschedule the second part of the psychometric to a time when the ppt is able to log back in to my RCC. 

A CeP ticket was created on JIRA for Chris Berglind to support.

CSC reached out to the rater and let them know they were able to get the participant in and continued the session on 19Apr22"

Hi Christy

 

Thank you for reaching out to us at REDCap Cloud. I just wanted to confirm the
company that you work with or the one you are carrying out the study for.
Qualmedica Research is not contracted with REDCap Cloud; is there another
company that is associated with your study? I would require their details to
triage your request for support appropriately.

 

Kind Regards,
