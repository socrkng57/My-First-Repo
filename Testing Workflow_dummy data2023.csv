Dear Team,

Site 724111 is having problems when trying to perform questionnaires using the
Chromebook.

They mentioned that it seems like an issue with the device itself, it does not
respond to touch in the touchscreen, nor using a mouse/keyboard. Is it possible
to send this one back to you and send them a new one?

Please let us know so we can tell the site.

Thank you.

not showing visit 100% complete

 

Message:

 



Hi ERT Support team,

 

Below is screenshot of the Cogstate assessment complete status. 

 

Screening and Week 0 visits show 50% complete but the battery tests were
completed and data received.  Therefore we are not sure why completion is at
50%.

 

Can you investigate and advise a solution please.  Thank you.

Thanks for reaching out, I attach the most recent newsletter for the AACM study which contains a section on troubleshooting for the Cogstate Battery. If none of these suggestions work (tablet orientation to be horizontal and fixed, browser maximized, good Wifi connection etc) could you please let me know what the error shows so I can provide some further troubleshooting? You could also try asking the ppt to complete the practice test on the participant’s tablet to see if you encounter the same issue.

Please let me know if you need to cancel the CDR sessions scheduled for today.

Could you please confirm if a phone number was created when this participant was set up in RCC? If so it is possible that the invite was sent to the phone number provided in the RCC profile instead. I can confirm on our end that an invitation was sent, and I just tried to re-send it again.

Could you please ask the ppt to use the study tablet and select ‘Forgot My Password’ and try to enter either the email and/or phone numbers associated within the account in RCC to see if she is able to gain access to her RCC account.

One of my participants did not receive the redcap cloud invitation email to activate their account for clinical assessments. Is there a way to try to send them another email or should I have them keep checking?

Thanks for reaching out. I can confirm that Ana Llambias is available to complete this session at 2pm today. As the session is being booked with less than 12 hours until the scheduled time of the meeting I will need to create the appointment manually on your behalf. As such, could you please provide me with the following information:
 
 
 
You will need to create a new updated zoom link for the session and password as the old link probably won’t work anymore. Let me know if you have any issues!

Thanks for your response. Could you please ask the participant to check their junk folder to see if the password reset email is going in there? 

Also, if there is nothing in junk, could you please let me know what message the tablet displays when a password reset is made on the tablet?

Hi Doug,

I hope this email finds you well. I’m just reaching out as our rater Liam let us know your ppt had some issues resetting their password in RCC. I’m attaching the most recent copy of our newsletter which provides guidance on resetting passwords in RCC which you may find useful (particularly if using an iPhone to try and reset). Please let me know if you require any further assistance on this or whether you have managed to reset and wish to reschedule this session for later today. Liam has let us know he has availability later to accommodate an appointment if needed.

I wanted to see if I was able to update the study partner ID. I did not input it correctly ,
I wrote 48385 instead of 48385.01.
I just wanted to see if there was a way of correcting it.

If the ppt is able to log in on her tablet once the password is reset, then it’s likely the tablet is populating the first character as a capital letter or similar automatically. Also just a note that if the ppt is changing their PW on a iPhone, the new password might not be taking effect as on iPhones the error message stating “this password doesn’t meet the minimum requirements” populates but the ppt needs to scroll up to see it.

Hi Tracy,
 
Sorry to hear the ppt is still having password issues. I just spoke with my colleague and they have seen this before where the ppt is inputting the wrong password and not catching it. Could you please verify if the ppt is able to log into RCC on another device, e.g. a smartphone or their PC, once they reset their password using the Forgot My Password function on the tablet?

Hi Tracy,
 
Thank you for reaching out. Regarding the orientation issue, if it is locked this is something which Clinical Ink can remediate, as they will need to remote in and take the orientation lock off. @support@clinicalink.com please could you remote into tablet Tablet IMEI#358590101130746 for the AACM study as the participant is unable to launch the battery correctly due to it being locked in portrait mode?
 
Regarding the password reset for this ppt, please ask the ppt to select the ‘Forgot my Password’ in the bottom right of the log in screen on the study device. They should be able to reset their password and log in through here.
 
 
 
Please let me know if you require any further assistance.

Importance: High
 
Hello Cogstate,
 
The above noted participant is unable to reset the password, the tablet has locked her out after several failed attempts.  We are at a standstill at resolving the problem.  Can a remote/manual reset of the tablet be done?  Tablet IMEI#358590101130746
 
During our initial log in for the practice test, the tablet was displaying the information vertically when she had her tablet turned horizontal. We tried every angle to resolve the problem.  The practice test could not be initated because she was unable to see all of the information completely.   I sent an email, as well as called and left a message regarding the issued, but no feedback.  Please advise, as this is hindering the progress of the patient's visit schedule.
 
Best regards,

Hello Tracy,

Due to the face that we cannot resolve the orientation lock for this subject's device. We advise contacting the Lilly team for a replacement device, as the Cogstate battery will need to be launched from landscape mode.

Thank you,
Morgan Beadle

Ppt 41183 (CSC Tracy Reed) – Cogstate Battery launching but not displaying correctly. Cogstate have reached out to ask for device number for this ppt as we believe the orientation is locked on ppt’s device and it is launching in portrait mode even when held horizontally. Clinical Ink will need to be contacted to fix this issue – to remote in and remove the fixed orientation so battery can launch correctly. Pending CSC response."

Also, is it possible to remove the phone number from their account?

Hi Jesse,
 
Thanks for reaching out. I just replied to your voicemail but thought I would follow up here too- can you please check the subject’s account in RCC to see if there are any other details associated with the account, e.g. a phone number in the account. If this is the case then the phone # will override the email for log in, so please ask the ppt to try and log in using this as the username and see if you are able to obtain access.

If so please could you let me know the ppt number so I am able to look this up on my side in RCC? I see the ticket contained the site number 15300 but no participant number.

Hi Katie,
I don't know, I have never encountered this before, so I'm not sure what would work.  I was thinking we could just delete her and then re-enter her info including her email and same subject ID but, I will do anything that you think will work.  I'm just afraid having a different subject ID in RCC then in the other platforms is going to be to confusing and may cause more problems down the road.

Hi Karin,
 
When you navigate to the Cogstate ID to the left of the subject number, if you copy what is in there and paste it into the myRCC username field, does it still come up as username not found? REDCap Cloud Copying and pasting what was invited will help us rule out if the username is being entered incorrectly.

Hi Karin,
 
If RCC is saying that the username is not found when sending the password reset then it’s possible that the username entered in the ppt’s RCC account is incorrect. Could you please double check that the email linked to the ppt’s account is correct by clicking on the Cogstate ID to the left of the subject number in RCC? And then verify with the ppt that the email they are using to log in is the same as the one they were invited with?

Hi Karin,
 
Okay, thanks for confirming that. With the invalid username, can you ask the ppt to actually copy and paste their email username from RCC into the ‘Forgot my Password’ section of the log in on the study tablet? I just want to triple check it is being entered correctly, and not auto-capitalising the username or anything, which could cause the ‘invalid username’ error message.

Hi Karin,
 
Thank you, I can confirm the invitation was sent to this participant as I can see the green tick to the right of the subject number in RCC. Did this ppt try to set themselves up an account in RCC prior to clicking on the invitation link (due to the fact that she could not locate the RCC invite in her emails)? If so this may cause the invalid username issue. Could you also confirm that a phone number was not used when setting up this ppt in RCC?

one of the site's Rater tried to access to her Cogstate account on the laptop

Can you please urgently unblock it? This is necessary due to an approaching

In October 2022 I received my ""Welcome to the Cogstate esource Platform"" email.
Because we were not ready to start, I don't believe I activated my account.
Since it is so old, the link is no longer active. I am scheduled to complete my

prior to that time, I would greatly appreciate it. Email is my best form of

To connect to Data, just toggle off the WiFi option. You may need to select “Forget” the WiFi network as well. Then Data Roaming should be initiated:

Hi Moultrie,
 
Just a thought – have you asked the ppt to try to launch the battery whilst positioned closer to their Wifi router in the house? Also try to disconnect and reconnect to the participant’s Wifi (in settings) to see if this makes a difference to the connectivity. I would advise that during the Cognitive Testing that the participant stands as close to the Wifi router as possible. If this still doesn’t work then we have had participant’s in the past complete assessments where there is a stronger Wifi connection (e.g. in a friend’s home). @Moultrie Vanderhorst -I  see that you were unsuccessful in removing Wifi on the participant’s device, could you please provide any assistance in helping Moultrie do this Malia?

Yes. I don't think this is a data issue. She is able to log into Cogstate and Zoom with no issue. It's the loading of the test when she was on with the Radar trying to complete the Cognitive Test part 1.

Thank you for your email.

Thank you also for attaching the set up guide, I can confirm the equipment was set up correctly.

The test supervisor stepped out during the last assessment. I wanted to flag this in case there are some data inconsistencies.

Moving forward we will ensure the supervisor is present in the room at all times during the test.

Hi Tracy,

I’m just following up again for an open ticket I have for ppt 37516. Is the participant now able to open the battery? We seem to be having several ppts with this issue and I’d just like to double check the Wifi for this ppt’s device if this is still an issue. Please check in with the participant and ensure that when they launch the battery they are close to their Wifi router. If the battery still wont launch, please try to disconnect the Wifi and ‘Forget’ the Wifi network in the settings and the tablet should connect to data. Please let me know if this solves the issue (you can try to launch the battery on the ppt’s device to see if this rectifies the problem).

I am contacting you because CSC Diana Giraldo [GiraldoD GiraldoD@centralclinicalservices.com] does not have access to the live Clinical Ink application in the tablet. She is only in the training environment. She contacted helpdesk and they  have her contact the study team.

As far as I know, she completed training successfully and I hope you can help her get this right.  I am working on a site transition and I need her to have all her accesses.

Below are a couple of screen shots that Diana provided for the tablet

Hi Diana,

No problem! You should be able to see the below sites now in RCC, I removed your training site access as all the training was completed, and the below sites are now live. You may need to sync your tablet to see the updates.

Hi Diana,
 
I did see you’d previously completed your courses on Instructor, so once the practice test is complete I can mark your training off manually. Apologies for the inconvenience on this.
 
To launch the practice test, please navigate back to RCC on your PC and click on the mock ppt number, and in the top right, select ‘add event’ and choose ‘practice’ from the drop down, and ‘save and exit’.
 
 
 
When you go back to the tablet you should see the option to launch the practice test.

Hi Diana,
 
I can see the previous curriculum completed, you will need to complete the final applied training step as shown below. Kerry re-enrolled you in the courses, but once you put “enroll” next to each course, it will automatically recognize you have previously watched the module. 
 
 
 
To complete the applied training on your study tablet, I have attached the instructions included in your welcome email.
 
Please let us know if you have any questions.
 
Best,
Delaney

I think you are referring to the Cogstate Instructor Training ?  I have just re enrolled you so you can perform the training test. It’s the last part before you can become active in Red Cap Cloud.  Please let me know if this solves the problem.

Hi Daisy, 
 
Would it be possible that we shift these appointments to Tuesday April 4th? Please let me know if this works for the study partner and participant. Failing that, would the study partner be available at 5.30pm on the 11th so that I can shift this appt to be with Milse? Please let me know if either of these works.

Thanks for reaching out. Unfortunately, both subjects are not available to conduct the visit at the same time, this is why we split the visit. Also, I don't have the option on my end to choose which rater can conduct the visit. 
 
Are you able to assist me with that? I don't want to cancel the appointments as the subject is traveling and also has a busy schedule for the month. 
 
Please advise -

Hi Daisy,
 
I hope this email finds you well. I’m reaching out as I noticed you have split appointments on ppt 33085 with different raters (Ana and Milse) on April 11th.
 
First, it is preferred that a CDR combined session is booked, and that the split CDR sessions are made only when this is impossible. 
 
Second, if the split CDR sessions are required, then both the study partner and study participant portions must be conducted with the same rater.
 
Please either cancel both split CDR bookings and book a combined CDR session or amend one of the split CDR sessions so that they are conducted with the same rater. 
 
If you need any help with this, please don’t hesitate to get in touch!
 
Many thanks,

The email invite cannot be moved between subjects as the subject account (Cogstate ID) is linked to whatever email is used when invited.

To correct this issue, Cogstate will have to reverse the previous request and update the subject number listed as 28870 to 28869 to have the correct email address used. I have looped in our data manager for best next steps for this piece.

Even with this, the participant should be able to login with the email address invited under 28870, can you try the troubleshooting with the below?

To troubleshoot the username:
1.	Copy the participants email from the invited email into this link: https://myrcc.login.redcapcloud.com/ 
2.	Select “Forgot Password?” in lower right to send a password reset/account reset.
3.	Repeat with phone number if phone was entered.

Hi Delaney,
 
Yes, I do have another question or concern for clarification.
 
When I initially created this Subject, the wrong e-mail address was utilized under ""28869."" I had to create another Subject (28870) to have been able to register with the ""correct"" e-mail address. Cogstate was able to help me switch the information to the correct Subject..
 
The issue is that your e-mail states to use the same email address that was ""originally"" used and the original email address in this case was incorrect.
 
Does this make sense? I can forward you the previous e-mail threads with what was done before.
 
 
 
Thanks, and I do apologize for the confusion.
 
Jazmin

Hi Jazmin,
 
It appears the participant did not login to their invited email or phone. Can you confirm no phone number was added to the participants account?
 
The participant will need to use the exact email address (such as caps or no caps, special characters etc.) as was invited OR the phone number if it was added during set-up to have the account linked.
 
To troubleshoot the username:
1.	Copy the participants email from the invited email into this link: https://myrcc.login.redcapcloud.com/

Today we had to cancel subject 28869 Cogstate Testing Part 1 due to an error on the Subject's tablet. Here is a screenshot of the error message:"

It sounds like the participant is trying to launch the assessment with the device held vertically. The error message populated will read along the lines of “the battery failed to launch. Please check your wifi connectivity or contact your administrator”. 

Confirm with the participant before launching that the device is on its side, with the power button on one side or the other. 

Please reach out if you have trouble launching with these provided steps.

Hi Poly,
My understanding is that Jiake booked her central rater at 1pm but asked for an earlier time, which I think might be the booking you are referring to here. Jiake’s patient just pre-screen failed after a discussion with the investigator this morning, so will not be coming in. Since I missed booking mine, I will take Jiake’s booking.

So just to confirm we have one central rater booking for our site, Sydney Emeritus Research at 10:30am today?

Thank you.

Kind regards.

My apologies, I just realised we have a patient booked for screening today, sorry this slipped passed my eyes as we recently had a change in booking methods with recruitment and the display of ACW0008 bookings changed.

Would there be any chance we can have a central rater any time rom 10:30am-12pm (Sydney, Australia time) or even later today (13th Feb)?

Hello,

I am writing regarding an online booking I have made for a central rating screen as part of clinical trial ACW0008. On Monday 13 February we have a participant attending for first screening visit at our clinic at 11:00hrs. The two times available to book for the central rating screen was 0900hrs and 15:00hrs. I understand that these times coincide with the availability of the central rater, however I wanted to get in touch and see if there is any way it could be conducted closer to midday or early afternoon after consent has been signed. I have currently booked the 0900hr time slot but will change it depending on your advice.

Thank you for your help.

Subject: FW: reschedule - MINI_ HAM-D

Hi Cogstate Team,
I realised my email did not send yesterday (due to a dot after the com in the email address) notifying that the patient rescheduled to 9am and if we can possibly have a rater at 10:30 or 11am whatever suits. It was originally booked for 12pm and requested for 11:30am in the notes. 

Booking details 




Service Name

	Central Rating (MINI & HAM-D) - Screening




When

	Tuesday, January 31, 2023
12:00 PM - 1:30 PM
(UTC+10:00) Canberra, Melbourne, Sydney

Subject: reschedule - MINI_ HAM-D

Hi,
I have a booking for a rater for tomorrow the 31st Jan 12-1:30pm but asked for 11:30am in the notes. The patient just called reschedule to 9am, will it be possible to have a rater at 10:30am/11am, if not possible we will keep 11:30am and change the order of events in the visit.
I tried to reschedule via the confirmation email but just brings me to a screen to do a new booking.

Sorry for the inconvenience and please let me know. 
Thank you!

Kind regards,

That is correct, you will need to select “practice” for the practice test to generate. The central rater will switch the participant to “in-study” at the beginning of Cog. Testing part I.

HI Tamara,
 
Thanks for reaching out. I can see in RCC that subject 42017 is set up as ‘In-study’ for the AACM study. Please navigate to the Cogstate ID to the left of the subject number, and select edit in the top right, and select ‘practice’ from the drop down, then save and exit.
 
 
 
Then select the subject number, and select ‘add event’ in the top right of the screen. You’ll then see ‘Practice’ on the drop down list, please save and then the practice test will appear on the events page for the subject. The ppt can now launch the practice test on their tablet.
 
Please let me know if you need any further help!

Subject: RE: 15T-MC-AACM - RCC/Cogstate registration issue - assistance needed
 
Hello, 
 
I am having issues registering a subject for a cognitive practice run that was to start today at 11am EST.  I have since called to postpone until I am able to get it fixed. 
 
On Friday, I went in and scheduled the CDR rater appointments (Combined for 3/24 and Cog pt 1 for 3/27) and the practice test for today.   But when I went in this morning to assign the practice test there was no option to do so.  Can you please assist me with this?
 
The site is 15700 and the subject is 42017.
 
Thank you!

The Rater Administered form completion status shows 50% but this is not reflected of a form being done. This status only reflects the CRF completion status, and currently there is a CRF pending. This could be because of an open query or additional investigation from the data team.

Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Hello,
 
Subject 16020 was scheduled for CDR combined yesterday at 6pm. When we got on the call, the forms would not populate for the rater so we had to move it to today. Partner in the morning and participant in the evening. So that made the Cognitive test part 1 that was scheduled for today to be moved. The subject can only do evenings for this and I do not see a time. She has to complete all 3 assessments within 7 days. Can you help?

Thanks for reaching out. If you navigate to the Cogstate Battery Assessment Confirmation I can see the practice test was completed yesterday 13th March. I think it only shows the 6th on the event date because that was the date the forms were first opened.

 
It now just needs to be saved and marked as complete in the top right corner.

Hi Delaney,

Unfortunately, using the subject's phone number also did not work to log her in to RCC.  What else can we try? We have her Part 1 rescheduled for today in about an hour. She gets home in about a half hour and we can try again to reset her password again using her email. Maybe if I try resending the invite? Any suggestions are welcome.

Hi Delaney,
 
This subject's phone number was originally entered when she was first registered in error.  It was quite a headache back at her V2 getting that resolved and setup with her email.  This subject's V2 was back in August 2022. Why would it reset with her phone number again? In the subject's profile on RCC it shows her email and phone number. I am unable to edit that.

Subject: Re: [EXTERNAL] AACM ppt 16693, V9 - URGENT 9am appt

Hi,

The participant was not able to make this appointment due to the time and us not knowing which part she would have to complete. I booked for 12 pm CST tomorrow but she would like to know if something becomes available today. 

Thanks

Hi LaShonda,
 
Apologies, I think I was confused as I didn’t realise this was the ppt who had skipped the V2 visit. I’m not sure if we were made aware that the practice assessment in RCC was also skipped for this participant, has this been communicated by yourself to Lilly? I think we can proceed with the V9 Psychometric session as we can see that the V9 CDR was completed on the 8th and there have been some delays already to this psychometric due to the ppt having COVID.
 
Kind regards,

Good morning,
 
Sorry, I was a bit confused. I took on this site a few months ago and learned that because of a miscommunication with the previous CSC that the V2's were not completed. It was decided by the study team during that time to just complete the CSSRS and forgo the rest of the V2 assessments. The participant is now on V9, should i still complete the V2 practice?
 
Thanks

Hi LaShonda,
 
I’m just reaching out as rater Rochelle let me know that she is scheduled a V9 with ppt 16693 this morning but that she could not see that either the practice test or the V2 has been completed for this ppt. Could you please confirm subject/visit number for the appt at 9am EST? If this is the correct ppt, we will need to cancel the appointment so that the practice test can be completed prior to the V2 CDR. Please let me know if you have any questions.

Hi Valerie,
 
Thanks for reaching out. I just checked these ppts in RCC and can see V2s are complete for both subjects. The 50% progress as shown below relates to an outstanding query and does not mean the tests are incomplete. Apologies I know this is confusing!
 
 
 
 
 
For this subject, I can see all parts of the test are complete as the icon to the left of each part shows the form has been opened (if a part hasn’t been opened it will show a filled in circle).

Currently, the functionality to update email addresses is not configured into the system. The email address the participant used to sign up for the study is the email address linked to their account and at this time cannot be updated. 
 
If the participant cannot access their previous email address, please alert us immediately.

I see that the practice test was launched but no data was collected. The audit log does not reflect any errors.

Please have the participant start the battery over again, a couple of items that could have caused the “crash” – 

•	The participant WiFi disconnecting before the tests are started
•	Hitting the home button on the tablet

Subject: participant practice testing

Hello, 

For AACM I5T site under PI Horstman:  I was working with participant 36881 from site 15550 (Care Access Sun City).  The patient started the practice cognitive testing session, but was telling me they were doing a card test, and not the standard practice.  The system was not registering any testing as completed on my visible end, and then the session crashed on the patient.   The patient is scheduled for Visit 2 on 08Mar2023 at 6am Arizona time, so they need to complete this practice before then. 

Is there any error showing that we can correct on our end?

I’m replying to your other email on this thread as the other contained PII. Cogstate is blinded to any participant details (including the email address). I will remove this email from our records.

It appears the participant might have changed their login information when the account was created. We have seen this issue before the email was updated after the invitation was sent (which generated the username). After the username was generated, the email was changed, but it’s not recognized as the username when trying to login. 

I will include on the request for the username.

I have completed the instructions below on relaunching the practice test for subject 32229. The subject was able to log in and when he “begins assessment” the error: There was an error launching the Cogstate Battery. Please make sure you are using the study device, stable internet.

Good Morning Alexandra, 

The protocol that I am referring to is IRB 16-005982 “ROR1662: Observational study evaluating neurocognitive function in patients with primary CNS malignancy receiving radiation treatment to the brain.”

When I try to install the COGSTATE database to my computer, it shows this pop-up. I have attached it to this email.

Hi Katie,
 
I try to schedule combined CDR session mostly. The subject 37867 and study partner both live in different states. The study partner is working, and the subject is very busy with doctor appointments and other stuff. I checked the central rating calendar, and the appointment times are very limited, and both are not available at the same time. My apologies as I didn't know that both need to be scheduled with the same rater. I will try to reschedule their appointments with the same rater. Thank you for letting me know.

	EXTERNAL EMAIL: Use caution before replying, clicking links, and opening attachments. 

Hi Sri,
 
I hope this email finds you well. I’m just reaching out as I noticed the split CDR sessions for ppt 37867 are booked with different raters. 
 
First, it is preferred that a CDR combined session is booked, and that the split CDR sessions are made only when this is impossible. 
 
Second, if the split CDR sessions are required, then both the study partner and study participant portions must be conducted with the same rater. The easiest way to achieve this is through the aforementioned combined CDR session.
 
Please see excerpt from the Manual of Operations for further guidance:
 
•	Cogstate Battery practice session must occur at least 1 day and no more than 7 days prior to the Study Partner CDR interview.
•	The CDR Rating session must occur prior to the psychometric Part I rating session.
 
•	CDR Rating Combined Session 90mins
o	To preserve data collection, It is ALWAYS preferred   to use a combined CDR session (study partner and participant). 
 
•	If a combined CDR session is not feasible (emergency cases):
•	The Study Partner portion MUST occur before the Study Participant portion and both sessions MUST occur within 4 calendar days of each other. Please book both sessions at the onset to ensure these strict time lines are adhered to.
•	First, CDR Study Partner Session 45mins
•	Second, CDR Study Participant Session 45mins
•	Psychometric Rating Combined Session 90mins
o	This visit cannot be split and must be conducted in one session. This rating is to conduct the Part I for the study participant 
•	The study partner and participant should be informed of the ratings total booked time (i.e. the participant and partner should plan on the rating lasting 90mins 
 
 
Please either cancel both split CDR bookings and book a combined CDR session or amend one of the split CDR sessions so that they are conducted with the same rater. 
 
If you need any help with this, please don’t hesitate to get in touch!

I hope this email finds you well. I’m just reaching out regarding your appointment today at 8.30am EST with rater Ana for ppt 39596. Ana alerted us that the V2 Rater and self administered forms have already been completed in RCC, but the practice test has not been generated or completed, so I believe this ppt has been set up as ‘In-study’ rather than ‘Practice’ in RCC. 

 

Unfortunately the completion of the V2 forms ahead of the V2 visit is a protocol deviation and as such as we will need to notify the sponsor. I am also going to loop in members of the data management team @Hannah Obasoro and @Kat Markowski to assist in advising on next steps (i.e. whether we can simply move this data from the V2 forms to be the ‘practice’, or whether any further action needs to be taken from the ppt, i.e. if they need to re-take the practice test). They will email you to confirm a data move if needed and once accepted by yourself we can work on rescheduling this ppt.

I am going to go ahead and cancel this appointment as these items will need to be resolved before the session can go ahead; please inform the participant and my apologies for the short notice on this. 

To generate the practice test form in RCC please follow the following steps:

Select the ‘Cogstate ID’ to the left of the subject number:
 
Once in the set up screen, please select edit in the top right corner, and from the drop down list, change ‘In-study’ to ‘Practice’, then press save and exit.

Finally, select the Subject number, and press ‘Add event’ in the top right. From the drop down, select ‘Practice’, then save and exit. The practice test will appear on the event page.

Please let me know if you require any assistance on this or have any questions.

Message:

Hi there,

The AbbVie team raised a couple of sites to Cogstate that reported a technical
issue during the administration. Please see below list and subject IDs.
Could you kindly reach out to the sites to see if they need support? The details
are unknown, but we are trying to be proactive here. Please let us know if you
need any further information from our end.

* 101 (subject 101001)
* 103 (subjects 103001, 103004)
* 107 (subject 107001)
* 108 (subject 108001)
* 128 (subject 128002)
* 140 (subject 140001)

Please note, some of these technical issues reported are one off as some of the
sites have been able to administer the assessment.

Warm regards,
Aki

Hi Cinthya,

Thank you for the explanation. I have removed the duplicates to what you have provided below. 

I noticed when I went to cancel these, the cancellation confirmations did not go through to you as the email address was “undeliverable” (c.perez@careaccess). This may have caused the duplicates as this isn’t a valid email address and therefore you wouldn’t have received the confirmations.

Kind regards,

Subject: RE: I5T-MC-AACM Participant 14550- 44517

Hi Delaney,

Good morning,

I remember I have cancelled the extra meetings for pt 44517 using the “Manage Booking” link. The appointments that I currently have for this pt are:

10Feb2023 at 10:30 CST
13Feb2023 at 10:00 CST

I don’t have other appointments in my calendar for this pt now, but in case there are other appointments in need of cancellation for this pt, I apologize for any confusion. Please let me know how I can cancel them.
The Cognitive testings Part-I that were booked and cancelled at the time of the visit due to delays in login belong to pt 40146. This pt is being evaluated by the PI because she has problems using the tablet. The re-scheduling was due to the time the pt takes to access the systems, and the raters were not in the ability to wait until pt completes login (sometimes 20-30 minutes after the scheduled visit time). She also has a very difficult temperament, and despite being requested to join the call at least 30’min in advance, she insists on coming 15 or sometimes 10 minutes before the appointment. I have sent an email to LaShan about this, and the medical team has suggested to request the PI consideration to decide if the pt will continue in the study.

I will be glad to provide more information about these or other pts if requested.

Best Regards,

Cinthya

Hi Cinthya,

I hope this email finds you well. I am reaching out as it appears we missed you for an appointment for participant 14550-44517. Upon further investigation, this participant has four visits scheduled for V2 assessments.


07Feb23 – Cognitive Testing Part I 2:30pm EST
10Feb23 – CDR Partner and Participant Interview 11:00am EST
10Feb23 – CDR Partner and Participant Interview 11:30am EST
13Feb23 – Cognitive Testing Part I 11am EST

Can you please confirm the appropriate dates and times for these appointments, then cancel the sessions that are duplicates? Having multiple appointments for the same participant takes up slots where other participants could be seen. Thank you in advance.

Kind regards,
Delaney

Thank you for letting us know. We do advise the practice test be retaken, though understandably the participant may not want to complete the practice again.

I have alerted the rater this CDR is back on the calendar tonight. Can you please provide the Zoom link for this appointment?

Patient will not redo the practice test. She says she knows she was near the end, and she will not do the test again. Further, we are on a tight timeline with her scheduled to leave town this Saturday Feb. 11th, the day after her final memory test. The CDR needs to occur today as scheduled. 

I need the CDR that was canceled, reinstated. I cannot do this on my end because I am within the 24 hour window.

Thanks for the heads up. 

Just fyi, it is much easier for the CSC to reschedule the rating assessments than to cancel them and start over. This saves us a considerable amount of time to not have to re-enter all the visit info, the CSC info, and Zoom info into Bookings. This can all be transferred instead if you reschedule, instead of cancel. In the future, you might consider holding off on canceling bookings until you talk to the CSC. ??

Thanks for getting the needed info.

	EXTERNAL EMAIL: Use caution before replying, clicking links, and opening attachments. 

Hi Darcie,

My apologies, I have just heard back from DM and the recommendation is that the practice test needs to be completed in full so that the participant may be exposed to each of the tests prior to their baseline visit. As a result, could you please navigate to the subject in RCC and in the top right corner select ‘Unmark as Complete’? This will allow the ppt to be able to relaunch the practice test on their tablet.

However, the protocol also states that the practice should occur 1-7 days prior to the CDR assessment, so in this case the CDR session will need to be rescheduled to ensure there is not a protocol deviation (i.e. the ppt is completing the practice test and CDR in the same day).

I will go ahead and cancel this CDR session now as it is less than 24 hours until the appointment, and please reschedule this CDR session to occur within the next 7 days.

If there is any way I could get a response by today at 5:30 EST, that would be helpful. Her next assessment is scheduled for that time, and if the practice test needs to be redone, I’ll need to reschedule that assessment with the rater.

Thank you for reaching out. Looking at both these subject ID’s created by CSC Nicki Whitely.

1052 = 31502
0968 = 31502.00

Subject ID 31502 has not yet been invited to myRCC. It appears that subject ID 31502.00 was invited to myRCC and the participant has not yet opened the invitation. 
 

An email address cannot be re-used within the system, therefore please verify the email address used in subject 31502.00 is NOT the email address the participant would like to use in the study. 

If it is the email address is indeed the one the participant would like to utilize –

1.	Re-send the email to the participant via myRCC page in the system (shown below as the green check, selecting this will open the invite page)
 
2.	Ensure the participant is using the email address/username exactly how it was entered on this page (usernames/emails are case sensitive, therefore they must match exactly what was invited)
3.	Update subject ID 31502 to TEST31502 to identify this one is not for use (for our data management team)
4.	Then you may update ID 31502.00 to the correct format 31502.
5.	Generate the Practice test in the system for the participant under 31502.


If the email address is not the address the participant would like to use –

1.	Update subject ID 31502.00 to TEST31502 to identify as a chart not to be used for our data management team.
2.	Invite subject ID 31502 to myRCC using whatever email address the participant would like to use
3.	Ensure the participant is using the email address/username exactly how it was entered on this page (usernames/emails are case sensitive, therefore they must match exactly what was invited)
4.	Generate the Practice test in the system for the participant under 31502.

Please let us know if we can provide any additional information regarding this.

Delaney

Can you please confirm if the account was successfully made in Cogstate (41593) and also please advise if she is locked out, if so can the account be unlocked for her to create another password for access? Thank you in advance!

I investigated the data received for this participant. It appears the participant closed the battery before completing the rest of the assessments. I do see data was collected through FNAME and BPSO, there are four more sets of tests past this section. The next section will begin with practice “yes” and “no”, I think the participant most likely thought they had completed and gone back to the beginning. 

Unfortunately, the participant will need to redo the whole assessment to complete all the necessary practice portions. 

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Best,
Delaney

  Eric Jones Message   Hey, this is Eric and I ran across cogstate.com a few
minutes ago.

Looks great… but now what?

By that I mean, when someone like me finds your website – either through Search
or just bouncing around – what happens next? Do you get a lot of leads from your
site, or at least enough to make you happy?

Honestly, most business websites fall a bit short when it comes to generating
paying customers. Studies show that 70% of a site’s visitors disappear and are
gone forever after just a moment.

Here’s an idea…

How about making it really EASY for every visitor who shows up to get a personal
phone call you as soon as they hit your site…

You can –

Talk With Web Visitor is a software widget that’s works on your site, ready to
capture any visitor’s Name, Email address and Phone Number. It signals you the
moment they let you know they’re interested – so that you can talk to that lead
while they’re literally looking over your site.

CLICK HERE https://boostleadgeneration.com to try out a Live Demo with Talk With
Web Visitor now to see exactly how it works.

You’ll be amazed - the difference between contacting someone within 5 minutes
versus a half-hour or more later could increase your results 100-fold.

It gets even better… once you’ve captured their phone number, with our new SMS
Text With Lead feature, you can automatically start a text (SMS) conversation.

That way, even if you don’t close a deal right away, you can follow up with text
messages for new offers, content links, even just “how you doing?” notes to
build a relationship.

Pretty sweet – AND effective.

CLICK HERE https://boostleadgeneration.com to discover what Talk With Web
Visitor can do for your business.

You could be converting up to 100X more leads today!

The participant can reset their account by selecting the “Forgot Password?” at the lower right of the login screen. This option works even if the participant has their account locked due to too many failed login attempts. 

It sounds the error message the participant was receiving is because they did not create a strong enough password for the account, password requirements below:

•	One special character 
•	One number 
•	One capital letter
•	At minimum 8 characters long

Hi Satoru,

Which user is trying to make edits to the CFT on the Clinical ink tablet? 

If there is no pencil (also, the title in the visit matrix will be italics), it means that the user’s role does not allow them to edit the form.

Once I know the user’s name I can check their role and confirm this.

Best,
Malia

Subject: I5T-MC-AACM: Confirmation Request for Cognitive Function Test Part 2 (Due Date: 24-Jan-2023)

Dear whom it may concerns,

I am Satoru Ohara of CRA who is in charge of Site #22450 in Protocol I5T-MC-AACM.
I contacted you to request confirmation for Cognitive Function Test Part II.
The site is scheduled to operate the corresponding test on the 25-Jan-2023, so please answer by the 24-Jan-2023.

Currently, the Site Rater screen is as shown below.
 

When the site staff select “Subject Attestation”, it will look like the figure below.
 

Originally, we think that a pencil mark will be displayed on the upper left side as shown in the figure below (excerpt from the manual), and the site staff/patient will be able to edit it.
 

Question 1
Does the fact that the pencil mark is not visible on the Rater screen and cannot be edited means that it is not visible on the Rater side because it is a page that the subject signs?
Also, is it possible for the subject to sign?
This appears as the form cannot be edited by the user who has the form open. Confirmation of user’s permissions will come from the Clinical Ink team (I’m tagging @Malia Schroeder please let me know if I should direct this to another individual). If the instruction in the job is different from what steps the user takes to edit, I’m adding in @obrien_christen_anne@lilly.com to confirm those changes need to take place. 23Jan23 DT
I understand that the user may not have permission to edit the form.
Could you please check the username that has been sent to Malia.
Also, if the user doesn't have permission to edit, could you please tell me how to deal with it on 25-Jan-2023?
Please let me know if there is an additional user role or if there is a user with authority on Site 22450. (24Jan2023, SO)

Question 2
As shown in the figure below, the CRF title: Start Cogstate Self-administered Cognitive Function Test (Practice) is in the pre-start status, is this a problem?
If there is a problem, how can we fix it?
This participant was administered the Cog. Part I events at the practice visit instead of the practice visit test. Per sponsor recommendation, the data is to be moved from V2_Rater Administered (Participant) to Practice. Our data management team is pending a query response to finish this work (I’ve included the query text below). A query notification was sent to the Chiho Murakami with a link to answer the query directly. DT 23Jan23
I will ask Site Staff to answer your query.
Will answering the query solve this problem?
If there's anything else the site need to do other than answer the query, please let me know. (24Jan2023, SO)

 

 

If there is any information you need, please contact us.
In addition, it is also possible to give instructions directly to the site by phone in Japanese, and I think that you can give clear instructions, so please consider this method as well.

Kind regards,

Satoru Ohara

Dear Sir/Madam

I kindly would like your help with my Cogstate access. When I try to login in my account, it asks me to press “Forgot password”, but when I follow that path, the system doesn’t recognize my username.(Please see below). I have tried using my email with capitals also (PerezC@centralclinicalservices.com) , but it doesn’t recognize it as well.

I beg your urgent attention to this matter, as I have a patient on the phone right now, and visits scheduled on this week.

Thanks in advance for your reply,

Subject: [EXTERNAL] RE: Subject #31502/Site #17650 Unable to register via Cogstate 
 
	EXTERNAL EMAIL: Use caution before replying, clicking links, and opening attachments. 

Hi Nicki,
 
Thank you for reaching out. Can you please clarify a couple of items below?
 
1.	Which account has listed the email address the participant would like to use? (31502 or 31502.01?) Please do not reply with any PII.
2.	Did the participant search their inbox for an email from noreply@redcapcloud.com? 
a.	Participant account 31502.01 was successfully invited, though the participant never opened the invitation (see below). 
b.	You can verify if the participant has opened the invite on the myREDCapCloud page within RCC.
 
It is never Cogstate recommendation to delete subject profiles within the system, as this is an EDC and therefore data cannot be removed. Additionally, once an email address has been invited, the email cannot be used again in the trial as it is linked to that subject ID.
 
To troubleshoot:
 
•	Have the participant search their inbox for the myRCC invite for subject 31502.01 (this can also be resent under the myREDCapCloud). The email will come from noreply@redcapcloud.com
•	Note the email address/username must be entered exactly as it was entered on the myREDCapCloud page. The username is capital sensitive and therefore will not recognize an email with caps v. no caps etc.
o	Sometimes the participant study tablets capitalized the first letter of the email on the login page, ensure this is not occurring. 
 
I apologize your having trouble reaching us via phone. To ensure you are received, please always call the Cogstate mainline (203 773 5010) as calling direct personnel numbers may direct you to the team members voicemail instead of re-routing. 
 
Best,
Delaney

Subject: Subject #31502/Site #17650 Unable to register via Cogstate 
 
Good afternoon,
 
I need assistance with registering subject#31502 via Cogstate. This is my 4th attempt trying to get the subject registered to begin her Practice run, but again I am unsuccessful. I am currently conducting the visit right now and Cogstate recognizes her email address, but wont allow her to request for a reset. Once she enters her email or phone, a message is received that the system does not recognize the account. I made a new account to enter a different email address and Cogstate would not allow an invitation to be sent because the system advises that the email is already linked to a Cogstate account. The previous accounts were deleted by Cogstate, but the email addresses are still attached. I tried calling for support, but I am unable to speak to anyone. Can Cogstate register this subject? Or can Cogstate send a link for registration directly to the subject to register? Why wont Cogstate allow the subject to self register? I am trying to think critically about alternatives to resolve this issue. Can someone from Cogstate login remotely to my portal to view what I am seeing to support me? Can you please advise? We cant get any further with the appt until this is resolved. Thank you!

Thank you for providing. The Cogstate battery is not able to launch when the participants device is in portrait mode (vertical). It can only launch when the participant tablet is turned on its side in landscape mode (horizontal) this can be verified by the power button being on the side versus the bottom of the tablet.

Hello,
I have been trying to complete subject 34730 practice test but the subject gets an error when they try to open the practice test in RCC, it says that the assessment cannot be loaded.
We have tried everything we can think of to get it to work, they have even tried the study partners tablet and got the same message.
I know the subject has tried to call the support line and has not been able to reach anyone.
The subject is scheduled for the practice test again on 1/27/23 and we need to get this issue resolved.
The subject has tried to shut down and restart the tablet, but it made no difference.

Your assistance is appreciated.

Hi Colleen,
 
The email is linked to the subject number and Cogstate ID (i.e. if you change the subject number after you have put in the email, that email will still be associated with that account). 
 
With that, the email will be associated with whatever site number the subject number is linked to currently. 
 
I think the best step is to verify each email is associated with the correct subject IDs. If they are, then the emails will be linked to that site.

Hi both,
 
Apologies for jumping in here. 
 
It sounds like the two issues below – (now that the subjects are at the correct sites)
 
Subject 34466 needs the year of birth changed from 1957 to 1956 - @Hannah Obasoro I’m not sure if this requires a query, I would look to you for expertise. 
 
Subject 31489, is the email address listed for this subject the correct address? If so, it sounds like the participant has already opened the email sent to them. Once the subject opens the original invite, the resend link will disappear. The participant can update/get into their account by placing their username (email) into myRCC on the tablet and selecting “Forgot Password?”. This will send them an account reset link.
 
Please let me know if this solution makes sense and covers the problem completely.
 
Best,
Delaney

Subject: Re: [EXTERNAL] RE: AACM Subject under wrong site
 
Hi Hannah,
 
The problem with this solution is that subject 34466 belongs to site 21950, not 20100.  I can change 34466 back to 31489 at site 21950, but then it will be under both sites. 31489 is correctly registered under 20100, but the email invite won't work. I don't have another subject to register for 20100 at this time.
 
 Thank you,

Hi Colleen,
 
Thank you for your email. Since it appears the invite is already associated with the original subject record, might I suggest the following to remedy the issue:
1.     Kindly “undo” the change of subject IDs:
a.     Please do this by updating subject ID 34466 to 31489 and vice versa. This means that subject 34466 will now appear under site 20100 as it originally was, and subject 31489 will appear under site 21950.
2.     After the subject ID updates have been made, then I can go in the database and correct the site IDs as originally planned. This way subject 31489 would still be linked to the original account created where the invite had already been sent.  I can also assist with having the subject demographics updated as needed. 
 
Please let me know as soon as the subject IDs have been switched so we can proceed with correcting their site IDs.
 
Thank you,
Hannah

Subject: Re: [EXTERNAL] RE: AACM Subject under wrong site
 
Hi Hannah,
 
I hope I didn't mess it up too bad, but I went ahead and changed the subject ID to a different subject I was going to have to add to site 21950 soon anyway.  So now it shows subject 34466 under site 21950 and subject 31489 under site 20100, but there are two other issues now.  Subject 34466 needs the year of birth changed from 1957 to 1956.  Subject 31489 needs a new invite to join RCC, but when I go to invite her under the correct site it says the email is already associated with an account and won't let me resend the invite.  Thank you for any help you can provide for this.
 
 Thank you,

Thanks for looping me in Delaney.
 
Hi Colleen,
 
I can assist with updating the subject’s site ID to the correct one. A query will be issued shortly to have you confirm the site change. Kindly review and respond to this query at your earliest convenience. Once we receive a response, we can proceed with moving the subject from site 21950 to 20100.
 
Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions.

Hi Katie,
 
Unfortunately, the only page that allows me to edit anything doesn't have the site number listed. The screenshot below doesn't have an edit.  When you click on the subject number it shows the demographics and no edit.  When you click the cogstate ID you can edit information but the site number is not an option.  I can change the subject to a different subject number for site 21950, but it won't allow me to change the year of birth. If I change the subject ID, can you help change the birth year? Then I should be able to add subject 31489 to the correct site.
 
 Thank you,

The data will be stored on the participant device until reconnected and synced. I’ve included the instructions for syncing the tablet after connection lost below. 
Support Information:
Did you lose connection to WIFI or internet during the Battery and saw the following image?
 
Please click on the following link as long as you are fully connected: https://platform.cogstate.com/sync.html
 
The participant will need to type in the link above on the tablet to sync the data. Once synced, you should see on the online portal that data has been received. You can also email us back and we can check for you.
Please reach out with any questions.

Subject: I5T-MC-AACM - Site 16150/Subject 34376 - V2 Self Administered Assessments Issue
Importance: High

Hello,

Subject 34376 from site 16150 had the Cognitive Testing Part 2 session today, January 10th. Subject’s tablet was running a bit slower than normal but subject was still able to launch the battery. Subject worked through each assessment, with the last one being the Face-Name test, but at the end subject just had a loading screen. We waited 5 or so minutes for the assessments to submit, but had no luck. I had subject check her Wi-Fi and we realized it had disconnected. The Wi-Fi router was restarted and tablet eventually reconnected to the Wi-Fi. Once connected, subject still had the loading screen and then the Cogstate app eventually logged her out. I had subject log back in and the V2 Self-Administered assessment was still marked as “Not Started”.

I am assuming this issue was a result of the lost Wi-Fi connection at some point during the assessment and unfortunately the assessments did not successfully submit. Are you able to confirm on your end that the assessments were completed? Can the data be backed up or will the assessment need to be repeated.

Please advise on next steps. Thank you!

Thank you for clarifying. From the screenshot provided below, it would appear the participant device is not presenting in landscape mode. 

If the participant puts it in portrait orientation, instruct to pick up and rotate until it’s correct. Note: The participant must pick up the tablet to rotate it and not rotate it on the surface. 

I’ve included a screenshot of what the device should look like in landscape/horizontal mode.

Yes, I can confirm that the patient was NOT holding the tablet and the tablet was placed on a desk near the modem, with the button facing the side. Thank you so much for your quick response.

Hi Nicki,
 
Thanks for the feedback, could you also just confirm In addition, the ppt is holding the study tablet horizontally (with button to the side) and is keeping it in this position (e.g. by laying it flat on the table)? It is important that when the ppt does open and complete the test, the tablet remains in this position as turning the tablet during the test can cause the test to close down.
 
This is helpful to troubleshoot.
 
Thank you!
 
Kerry




Hi Nicki,

Thanks for reaching out. I just checked the status of the practice test on RCC and can confirm it appears unopened. Could you please confirm that the ppt has checked the tablet is connected to the Wifi and has a strong connection (e.g. is close to the router). Often the test will not open if the Wifi connection is too weak or keeps cutting out. In addition, could you please confirm that the ppt is holding the study tablet horizontally (with button to the side) and is keeping it in this position (e.g. by laying it flat on the table)? It is important that when the ppt does open and complete the test, the tablet remains in this position as turning the tablet during the test can cause the test to close down.

Good afternoon,

I am requesting technical support for the above subject's tablet/Cogstate profile. The subject was unable to complete the Practice Run as it would not load. I coached the subject on several troubleshooting methods, but nothing has worked to load the Practice Run. The subject's tablet IMEI# 358590101123212. The tablet was rebooted twice and the subject was advised to keep the tablet on the power source. Can you please assist? Thank you!"

In RCC, there is no participant under this ID number at site 15050. We show a 34979-participant number who has completed their practice test. Can you please confirm if these are the same participant? If so, which participant number is correct?

Hi Michelle,

I hope this email finds you well. I’m just reaching out as I was processing the new bookings this morning and noticed that you have booked 4 split CDR appts for ppt 42779 on 24th January. I can see two of these are with Nana, one with Zahra and one with Aaron. I am going to go ahead and cancel the appts with Zahra and Aaron as the split CDRs need to occur with the same rater, so it makes sense to keep the two with Nana. 

In future, please use the cancel or edit/reschedule function on your booking confirmation to rearrange any appts, rather the creating new ones. This means that the appointments on rater calendars  can be used for other participants. Please reach out if you need any assistance in this or have any other queries.

I have started a new email chain here which does not contain the participants email address (PII). Please note we will be deleting the previous email threads to remove the PII from our systems per our agreement with Lilly.

“The above subject is having issues with registering with Cogstate. I believe it may be becuase her profile was attached to an incorrect email invitation that was sent to another participant in error. The invitation link was sent to ****** via the cogstate portal at least 4 times. Each time, the participant was not given the option to enter her name and create a pw. The system requested her email and/or phone as if an account was already created.
 
Can I request to have her profile deleted in cogstate and I re-enter the info again with the correct email address? I tried to re-enter the data, but the system would not allow as the subject ID was duplicate. Thanks in advance!”


You can create another participant profile for this participant in RCC with the email address. First you will need to edit the current subject ID to “test31502”. Once this has been done, you can create a new subject ID under 30456 and attempt to register the other email address. I included some screenshots below.
 
Select Cogstate ID for the participant number
 
Select Edit in the top right
 
Now you will be able to edit the subject number. Update the previous subject number to Test31502 and proceed with the normal steps to create subject 31502 again in the system.

Please let us know if you have any questions.

Hi Nicki,
 
Thanks for the feedback, could you also just confirm In addition, the ppt is holding the study tablet horizontally (with button to the side) and is keeping it in this position (e.g. by laying it flat on the table)? It is important that when the ppt does open and complete the test, the tablet remains in this position as turning the tablet during the test can cause the test to close down.
 
This is helpful to troubleshoot.
 
Thank you!

Goodmorning,
 
We tried again today to complete the practice test, utilizing the specific instructions that were forwarded in the previous email and this attempt was unsuccessful as well. I also advised the subject to reboot her modem, refresh her wifi signal/connection and leave the tablet plugged in while attempting to access the practice test. None of these tactics worked as she is still getting the error message I mentioned in the previous email. Please see below screenshot of the error message she continues to receive each time she tries to access the test. Please advise. Thank you!

Hi Nicki,
 
Thanks for reaching out. I just checked the status of the practice test on RCC and can confirm it appears unopened. Could you please confirm that the ppt has checked the tablet is connected to the Wifi and has a strong connection (e.g. is close to the router). Often the test will not open if the Wifi connection is too weak or keeps cutting out. In addition, could you please confirm that the ppt is holding the study tablet horizontally (with button to the side) and is keeping it in this position (e.g. by laying it flat on the table)? It is important that when the ppt does open and complete the test, the tablet remains in this position as turning the tablet during the test can cause the test to close down.
 
Kind regards,

Good afternoon,
 
I am requesting technical support for the above subject's tablet/Cogstate profile. The subject was unable to complete the Practice Run as it would not load. I coached the subject on several troubleshooting methods, but nothing has worked to load the Practice Run. The subject's tablet IMEI# 358590101123212. The tablet was rebooted twice and the subject was advised to keep the tablet on the power source. Can you please assist? Thank you!
